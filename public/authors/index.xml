      <description>Dr. Kriegstein’s research focuses on the way in which neural stem and progenitor cells produce neurons in the embryonic brain. His lab found that radial glial cells, long thought to simply guide nerve cells during migration, are neuronal stem cells in the developing brain.</description>

      <description>Jonathan is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Kriegstein Lab. He is interested in using human cortical organoids to model neurodevelopmental disorders in vitro. He utilizes traditional molecular biological approaches in tandem with bioinformatics to profile changes in fate specification during neurodevelopment.</description>

      <guid>https://example.com/author/li-zhou-phd/</guid>
      <description>Dr. Zhou is interested in dissecting human brain circuit development. During his Ph.D., he found a new &amp;ldquo;push-pull&amp;rdquo; circuit mechanism to control the E-I balance of rodent serotonin neurons: individual cells could receive excitation and inhibition inputs from the same brain area.</description>

      <guid>https://example.com/author/songcang-chen-md/</guid>
      <description>Dr. Chen’s research mainly focuses on vitamin D receptor (VDR) biology and the role of vitamin D in hypertension and cardiometabolic disease. He successfully generated floxed VDR mice and developed several types of tissue/cell-specific VDR knockout mice including CD4+ T lymphocytes.</description>

      <guid>https://example.com/author/tanzila-mukhtar-phd/</guid>
      <description>Dr. Mukhtar is interested in the signaling and transcriptional networks that maintain neural stem cells, are responsible for cortical layering and control cell fate. She is working on understanding the temporal changes in isoforms during human cortical development and uses both primary human tissue and iPSC-derived cerebral organoids to study the isoform landscape in the neurogenic/gliogenic lineage.</description>
