However, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of vascular cell maturation is lacking, especially in the prenatal human brain. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, single-cell transcriptomics, and histological and ultrastructural analyses, we show that an ensemble of endothelial and mural cell subtypes tile the brain vasculature during the second trimester. These vascular cells follow distinct developmental trajectories and utilize diverse signaling mechanisms, including collagen, laminin, and midkine, to facilitate cell-cell communication and maturation. Interestingly, our results reveal that tip cells, a subtype of endothelial cells, are highly enriched near the ventricular zone, the site of active neurogenesis. Consistent with these observations, prenatal vascular cells transplanted into cortical organoids exhibit restricted lineage potential that favors tip cells, promotes neurogenesis, and reduces cellular stress. Together, our results uncover important mechanisms into vascular maturation during this critical period of human brain development.","tags":["angiogenesis; arterial endothelial cells; blood brain barrier; cortical organoids; endothelial cells; human prenatal brain development; mural cells; pericytes; smooth muscle cells; tip cells; venous and capillary endothelial cells; ventricular zone"],"title":"Ensembles of endothelial and mural cells promote angiogenesis in prenatal human brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Madeline G Andrews","Lakshmi Subramanian","Jahan Salma","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"30c52d8b0c1b436f83b7c6815b7d6ec7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/andrews-2022-uu/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.03606Z","relpermalink":"/publication/andrews-2022-uu/","section":"publication","summary":"Apical-basal progenitor cell polarity establishes key features of the radial and laminar architecture of the developing human cortex.

To assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we utilized stem-cell-derived cortical organoids as well as primary human cortical tissue, both from developmental and adult stages. We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary tissue and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected and bystander astrocytes have a corresponding increase in inflammatory gene expression, reactivity characteristics, increased cytokine and growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, particularly astrocytes, have no observable ACE2 expression, we find high levels of coronavirus coreceptors in infected astrocytes, including CD147 and DPP4. Decreasing coreceptor abundance and activity reduces overall infection rate, and increasing expression is sufficient to promote infection.

ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.","tags":["Zika virus; centrosome; innate immunity; microcephaly"],"title":"Zika virus alters centrosome organization to suppress the innate immune response","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aparna Bhaduri","Elizabeth K Neumann","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Jonathan V Sweedler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"da161d08a0ce5f07e92d31e02aed67db","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/bhaduri-2021-ch/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.088268Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhaduri-2021-ch/","section":"publication","summary":"The lipidome is currently understudied but fundamental to life.

Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile ten major brain structures and six neocortical areas during peak neurogenesis and early gliogenesis. Within the neocortex, we find that early in the second trimester, a large number of genes are differentially expressed across distinct cortical areas in all cell types, including radial glia, the neural progenitors of the cortex. However, the abundance of areal transcriptomic signatures increases as radial glia differentiate into intermediate progenitor cells and ultimately give rise to excitatory neurons. Using an automated, multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization approach, we find that laminar gene-expression patterns are highly dynamic across cortical regions. Together, our data suggest that early cortical areal patterning is defined by strong, mutually exclusive frontal and occipital gene-expression signatures, with resulting gradients giving rise to the specification of areas between these two poles throughout successive developmental timepoints.","tags":null,"title":"An atlas of cortical arealization identifies dynamic molecular signatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sajad Hamid Ahanger","Ryan N Delgado","Eugene Gil","Mitchel A Cole","Jingjing Zhao","Sung Jun Hong","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Tomasz J Nowakowski","Alex A Pollen","Daniel A Lim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"b0a9216e874b312aa1b429852243f5eb","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/ahanger-2021-ke/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.082148Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahanger-2021-ke/","section":"publication","summary":"Nuclear compartments are thought to play a role in three-dimensional genome organization and gene expression.

The potential diversity of the nIPC population, that produces a significant portion of excitatory cortical neurons, is understudied, particularly in the developing human brain. Here we explore the spatiotemporal, transcriptomic, and morphological variation that exists within the human nIPC population and provide a resource for future studies. We observe that the spatial distribution of nIPCs in the cortex changes abruptly around gestational week (GW) 19/20, marking a distinct shift in cellular distribution and organization during late neurogenesis. We also identify five transcriptomic subtypes, one of which appears at this spatiotemporal transition. Finally, we observe a diversity of nIPC morphologies that do not correlate with specific transcriptomic subtypes. These results provide an analysis of the spatiotemporal, transcriptional, and morphological diversity of nIPCs in developing brain tissue and provide an atlas of nIPC subtypes in the developing human cortex that can benchmark in vitro models of human development such as cerebral organoids and help inform future studies of how nIPCs contribute to cortical neurogenesis.","tags":["cortex; development; human; neuronal; progenitor"],"title":"Human intermediate progenitor diversity during cortical development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ugomma C Eze","Aparna Bhaduri","Maximilian Haeussler","Tomasz J Nowakowski","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"3e713fedd89af732690c0462e537eea9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/eze-2021-aw/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.076287Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eze-2021-aw/","section":"publication","summary":"The human cortex comprises diverse cell types that emerge from an initially uniform neuroepithelium that gives rise to radial glia, the neural stem cells of the cortex.

For example, previous studies using single-cell RNA sequencing identified at least 9 major cell types and up to 26 distinct subtypes in the dorsal cortex alone(1,2). Here we characterize cell-type-specific cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational samples of the human cortex. We show that chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated variants enriched at distal interacting regions in a cell-type-specific manner.

The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is active in human oRG cells. Mutations in mTOR pathway genes are linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of cortical development. We find that dysregulation of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but do not affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold. Our study provides insight into how mTOR dysregulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.","tags":["human; human cortex; neuroscience; organoids; outer radial glia; regenerative medicine; stem cells"],"title":"mTOR signaling regulates the morphology and migration of outer radial glia in developing human cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin R Parker","Denis Migliorini","Eric Perkey","Kathryn E Yost","Aparna Bhaduri","Puneet Bagga","Mohammad Haris","Neil E Wilson","Fang Liu","Khatuna Gabunia","John Scholler","Thomas J Montine","Vijay G Bhoj","Ravinder Reddy","Suyash Mohan","Ivan Maillard","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Carl H June","Howard Y Chang","Jr, Avery D Posey","Ansuman T Satpathy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"bbcb5dba6a77a3f5a3d96c05ff407a42","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/parker-2020-tr/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.094219Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parker-2020-tr/","section":"publication","summary":"CD19-directed immunotherapies are clinically effective for treating B cell malignancies but also cause a high incidence of neurotoxicity.

In addition, single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals selective loss of excitatory neurons at disease end-stage, which is characterized by prominent nuclear and cytoplasmic TDP-43 granules and nuclear pore defects.

ASD is characterized by social deficits and a range of other phenotypes, implicating complex genetics and involvement of a variety of brain regions. However, how mutations and mis-expression of select gene sets are associated with the behavioral components of ASD remains unknown. We reasoned that for genes to be associated with ASD core behaviors they must be: (1) expressed in brain regions relevant to ASD social behaviors and (2) expressed during the ASD susceptible window of brain development. METHODS: Focusing on the amygdala, a brain region whose dysfunction has been highly implicated in the social component of ASD, we mined publicly available gene expression databases to identify ASD-susceptibility genes expressed during human and mouse amygdala development. We found that a large cohort of known ASD susceptibility genes is expressed in the developing human and mouse amygdala. We further performed analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from microdissected amygdala tissue from five ASD and five control human postmortem brains ranging in age from 4 to 20 years to elucidate cell type specificity of amygdala-expressed genes and their dysregulation in ASD. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that of the high-ranking ASD susceptibility genes, 80 are expressed in both human and mouse amygdala during fetal to early postnatal stages of development. Our human snRNA-seq analyses revealed cohorts of genes with altered expression in the ASD amygdala postnatally, especially within excitatory neurons, with dysregulated expression of seven genes predicted from our datamining pipeline. LIMITATIONS: We were limited by the ages for which we were able to obtain human tissue; therefore, the results from our datamining pipeline approach will require validation, to the extent possible, in human tissue from earlier developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our pipeline narrows down the number of amygdala-expressed genes possibly involved in the social pathophysiology of ASD. Our human single-nucleus gene expression analyses revealed that ASD is characterized by changes in gene expression in specific cell types in the early postnatal amygdala.","tags":["ASD genes; Amygdala; Autism spectrum disorder; Brain development; Single nucleus RNA sequencing"],"title":"Identification of amygdala-expressed genes associated with autism spectrum disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoyu Yang","Seth Bergenholtz","Lenka Maliskova","Mark-Phillip Pebworth","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Yun Li","Yin Shen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"e6ee0b67c9c75147d048793d9a2d4567","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/yang-2020-ft/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.121509Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2020-ft/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate RNA quantification at the single-cell level is critical for understanding the dynamics of gene expression and regulation across space and time.

In vivo lineage-tracing study revealed that GSX2(+) IPC population gives rise not only to OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population. We demonstrated that Sonic hedgehog signaling is both necessary and sufficient for the generation of GSX2(+) IPCs by reducing GLI3R protein levels.

To identify human-specific features of cortical development, we leveraged recent innovations that permit generating pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids from chimpanzee. Despite metabolic differences, organoid models preserve gene regulatory networks related to primary cell types and developmental processes. We further identified 261 differentially expressed genes in human compared to both chimpanzee organoids and macaque cortex, enriched for recent gene duplications, and including multiple regulators of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. We observed increased activation of this pathway in human radial glia, dependent on two receptors upregulated specifically in human: INSR and ITGB8.

Progenitor cells and newborn neurons respond to signaling cues, including neurotransmitters. While single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed cellular diversity, physiological heterogeneity has yet to be mapped onto these developing and diverse cell types. By combining measurements of intracellular Ca(2+) elevations in response to neurotransmitter receptor agonists and RNA sequencing of the same single cells, we show that Ca(2+) responses are cell-type-specific and change dynamically with lineage progression. Physiological response properties predict molecular cell identity and additionally reveal diversity not captured by single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the serotonin receptor HTR2A selectively activates radial glia cells in the developing human, but not mouse, neocortex, and inhibiting HTR2A receptors in human radial glia disrupts the radial glial scaffold. We show highly specific neurotransmitter signaling during neurogenesis in the developing human neocortex and highlight evolutionarily divergent mechanisms of physiological signaling.","tags":["calcium imaging; differentiation; human neocortical development; intermediate progenitor cells; neurogenesis; neurotransmitter; radial glia; radial glia scaffold; serotonin; single-cell RNA sequencing"],"title":"Multimodal Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Physiological Maturation in the Developing Human Neocortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Istvan Adorjan","Teadora Tyler","Aparna Bhaduri","Samuel Demharter","Cintia Klaudia Finszter","Maria Bako","Oliver Marcell Sebok","Tomasz J Nowakowski","Konstantin Khodosevich","Kjeld Møllgård","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Lei Shi","Anna Hoerder-Suabedissen","Olaf Ansorge","Zoltán Molnár"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d84bc0dbb1b64755151e9d97fc45c2c5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/adorjan-2019-rx/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.20559Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adorjan-2019-rx/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuroserpin is a serine-protease inhibitor mainly expressed in the CNS and involved in the inhibition of the proteolytic cascade. Animal models confirmed its neuroprotective role in perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia and adult stroke.

The present study provides a detailed description of the changing spatiotemporal patterns of neuroserpin focusing on physiological human brain development. Five stages were distinguished within our examined age range which spanned from the 7th gestational week until adulthood. In particular, subplate and deep cortical plate neurons were identified as the main sources of neuroserpin production between the 25th gestational week and the first postnatal month. Our immunohistochemical findings were substantiated by single cell RNA sequencing data showing specific neuronal and glial cell types expressing neuroserpin. The characterization of neuroserpin expression during physiological human brain development is essential for forthcoming studies which will explore its involvement in pathological conditions, such as perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia and adult stroke in human.","tags":["human brain; neurodevelopment; neuroserpin; subplate"],"title":"Neuroserpin expression during human brain development and in adult brain revealed by immunohistochemistry and single cell RNA sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mercedes F Paredes","Shawn F Sorrells","Arantxa Cebrian-Silla","Kadellyn Sandoval","Dashi Qi","Kevin W Kelley","David James","Simone Mayer","Julia Chang","Kurtis I Auguste","Edward F Chang","Antonio J Gutierrez Martin","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Gary W Mathern","Michael C Oldham","Eric J Huang","Jose Manuel Garcia-Verdugo","Zhengang Yang","Arturo Alvarez-Buylla"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"f103b7426d248e987583bf9beaa40486","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/paredes-2018-uu/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.212674Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paredes-2018-uu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Does Adult Neurogenesis Persist in the Human Hippocampus?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomasz J Nowakowski","Neha Rani","Mahdi Golkaram","Hongjun R Zhou","Beatriz Alvarado","Kylie Huch","Jay A West","Anne Leyrat","Alex A Pollen","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Linda R Petzold","Kenneth S Kosik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"1aaeea6b6d6d70e536332666c9660d3b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/nowakowski-2018-ma/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.216161Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nowakowski-2018-ma/","section":"publication","summary":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many cellular events during brain development by interacting with hundreds of mRNA transcripts. However, miRNAs operate nonuniformly upon the transcriptional profile with an as yet unknown logic. Shortcomings in defining miRNA-mRNA networks include limited knowledge of in vivo miRNA targets and their abundance in single cells. By combining multiple complementary approaches, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation with an antibody to AGO2 (AGO2-HITS-CLIP), single-cell profiling and computational analyses using bipartite and coexpression networks, we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate as functional modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo dynamic transitions during brain development. These networks are highly dynamic during development and over the course of evolution. One such interaction is between radial-glia-enriched ORC4 and miR-2115, a great-ape-specific miRNA, which appears to control radial glia proliferation rates during human brain development.","tags":null,"title":"Regulation of cell-type-specific transcriptomes by microRNA networks during human brain development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aparna Bhaduri","Tomasz J Nowakowski","Alex A Pollen","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"852e2e9ebd176247bd17bd2fb7076709","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/bhaduri-2018-ew/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.224802Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhaduri-2018-ew/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: High throughput methods for profiling the transcriptomes of single cells have recently emerged as transformative approaches for large-scale population surveys of cellular diversity in heterogeneous primary tissues. However, the efficient generation of such atlases will depend on sufficient sampling of diverse cell types while remaining cost-effective to enable a comprehensive examination of organs, developmental stages, and individuals. RESULTS: To examine the relationship between sampled cell numbers and transcriptional heterogeneity in the context of unbiased cell type classification, we explored the population structure of a publicly available 1.3 million cell dataset from E18.5 mouse brain and validated our findings in published data from adult mice. We propose a computational framework for inferring the saturation point of cluster discovery in a single-cell mRNA-seq experiment, centered around cluster preservation in downsampled datasets. In addition, we introduce a ``complexity index,'' which characterizes the heterogeneity of cells in a given dataset. Using Cajal-Retzius cells as an example of a limited complexity dataset, we explored whether the detected biological distinctions relate to technical clustering. Surprisingly, we found that clustering distinctions carrying biologically interpretable meaning are achieved with far fewer cells than the originally sampled, though technical saturation of rare populations such as Cajal-Retzius cells is not achieved. We additionally validated these findings with a recently published atlas of cell types across mouse organs and again find using subsampling that a much smaller number of cells recapitulates the cluster distinctions of the complete dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that most of the biologically interpretable cell types from the 1.3 million cell database can be recapitulated by analyzing 50,000 randomly selected cells, indicating that instead of profiling few individuals at high ``cellular coverage,'' cell atlas studies may instead benefit from profiling more individuals, or many time points at lower cellular coverage and then further enriching for populations of interest. This strategy is ideal for scenarios where cost and time are limited, though extremely rare populations of interest (\u003c 1%) may be identifiable only with much higher cell numbers.","tags":["Bioinformatics; Cell atlas studies; Downsampling; Single-cell analysis"],"title":"Identification of cell types in a mouse brain single-cell atlas using low sampling coverage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandrasekhar S Raju","Julien Spatazza","Amelia Stanco","Phillip Larimer","Shawn F Sorrells","Kevin W Kelley","Cory R Nicholas","Mercedes F Paredes","Jan H Lui","Andrea R Hasenstaub","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Arturo Alvarez-Buylla","John L Rubenstein","Michael C Oldham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"a0d17b3cec8e7f371659e84f6855740a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/raju-2018-db/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.239498Z","relpermalink":"/publication/raju-2018-db/","section":"publication","summary":"The neocortex of primates, including humans, contains more abundant and diverse inhibitory neurons compared with rodents, but the molecular foundations of these observations are unknown.

Integrating genomic annotations at the level of nucleotides, genes, and regulatory regions, we define 51,801 annotation categories. Analyses of 519 autism spectrum disorder families did not identify association with any categories after correction for 4,123 effective tests. Without appropriate correction, biologically plausible associations are observed in both cases and controls. Despite excluding previously identified gene-disrupting mutations, coding regions still exhibited the strongest associations. Thus, in autism, the contribution of de novo noncoding variation is probably modest in comparison to that of de novo coding variants.

This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18-77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved.","tags":null,"title":"Human hippocampal neurogenesis drops sharply in children to undetectable levels in adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sören Müller","Gary Kohanbash","S John Liu","Beatriz Alvarado","Diego Carrera","Aparna Bhaduri","Payal B Watchmaker","Garima Yagnik","Elizabeth Di Lullo","Martina Malatesta","Nduka M Amankulor","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Daniel A Lim","Manish Aghi","Hideho Okada","Aaron Diaz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"63aa1ba49c433630b7b7ade2b2e64812","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/muller-2017-zp/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.252849Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muller-2017-zp/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in gliomas and immunosuppressive TAMs are a barrier to emerging immunotherapies. It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. RESULTS: We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs.","tags":["Glioma; Immunotherapy; Macrophage; Single-cell sequencing"],"title":"Single-cell profiling of human gliomas reveals macrophage ontogeny as a basis for regional differences in macrophage activation in the tumor microenvironment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomasz J Nowakowski","Aparna Bhaduri","Alex A Pollen","Beatriz Alvarado","Mohammed A Mostajo-Radji","Elizabeth Di Lullo","Maximilian Haeussler","Carmen Sandoval-Espinosa","Siyuan John Liu","Dmitry Velmeshev","Johain Ryad Ounadjela","Joe Shuga","Xiaohui Wang","Daniel A Lim","Jay A West","Anne A Leyrat","W James Kent","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"f27323b9f5770320a1f4e2aaed7e75a7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/nowakowski-2017-et/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.246169Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nowakowski-2017-et/","section":"publication","summary":"Systematic analyses of spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories during organogenesis have been challenging because diverse cell types at different stages of maturation and differentiation coexist in the emerging tissues.

Congenital ZIKV infection produces a range of mild to severe pathologies, including microcephaly. To understand the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection, we used models of the developing brain that faithfully recapitulate the tissue architecture in early to midgestation. We identify the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2,177 compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy. We show that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced viral proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and human astrocytes. Our characterization of infection in the developing human brain clarifies the pathogenesis of congenital ZIKV infection and provides the basis for investigating possible therapeutic strategies to safely alleviate or prevent the most severe consequences of the epidemic.","tags":["Zika virus; azithromycin; cortical development; microcephaly"],"title":"Zika virus cell tropism in the developing human brain and inhibition by azithromycin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomasz J Nowakowski","Alex A Pollen","Carmen Sandoval-Espinosa","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"ab9f49eee108e66c54e8c645966fd042","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/nowakowski-2016-cy/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.27295Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nowakowski-2016-cy/","section":"publication","summary":"The classic view of cortical development, embodied in the radial unit hypothesis, highlights the ventricular radial glia (vRG) scaffold as a key architectonic feature of the developing neocortex.

Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are highly expressed in subsets of cells within tissues, despite appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations. RESULTS: We use strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development, and we apply this reference to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs are generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell transcriptomics of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched in single radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues. CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA regulates cell proliferation.

In the lissencephalic rodent brain, pyramidal neurons are born in the ventricular and subventricular zones of the pallium and migrate along radial glia fibers to reach the appropriate cortical layer. Although much less is known about neuronal migration in species with a gyrencephalic cortex, retroviral studies in the ferret and primate suggest that, unlike the rodent, pyramidal neurons do not follow strict radial pathways and instead can disperse horizontally. However, the means by which pyramidal neurons laterally disperse remain unknown. In this study, we identified a viral labeling technique for visualizing neuronal migration in the ferret, a gyrencephalic carnivore, and found that migration was predominantly radial at early postnatal ages. In contrast, neurons displayed more tortuous migration routes with a decreased frequency of cortical plate-directed migration at later stages of neurogenesis concomitant with the start of brain folding. This was accompanied by neurons migrating sequentially along several different radial glial fibers, suggesting a mode by which pyramidal neurons may laterally disperse in a folded cortex. These findings provide insight into the migratory behavior of neurons in gyrencephalic species and provide a framework for using nonrodent model systems for studying neuronal migration disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Elucidating neuronal migration dynamics in the gyrencephalic, or folded, cortex is important for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. Similar to the rodent, we found that neuronal migration was predominantly radial at early postnatal ages in the gyrencephalic ferret cortex. Interestingly, ferret neurons displayed more tortuous migration routes and a decreased frequency of radial migration at later ages coincident with the start of cortical folding. We found that ferret neurons use several different radial glial fibers as migratory guides, including those belonging to the recently described outer radial glia, suggesting a mechanism by which ferret neurons disperse laterally. It is likely that excitatory neurons horizontally disperse in other gyrencephalic mammals, including the primate, suggesting an important modification to the current model deduced primarily from the rodent.","tags":["ferret; gyrencephaly; neuronal migration"],"title":"Neuronal Migration Dynamics in the Developing Ferret Cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Using dynamic imaging, immunostaining, and clonal analysis, we relate these molecular features to distinctive behaviors of outer radial glia, demonstrate the necessity of STAT3 signaling for their cell cycle progression, and establish their extensive proliferative potential.

By analysing differential gene co-expression relationships between the species, we demonstrate that the growth factor PDGFD is specifically expressed by RG in human, but not mouse, corticogenesis. We also show that the expression domain of PDGFR$β$, the cognate receptor for PDGFD, is evolutionarily divergent, with high expression in the germinal region of dorsal human neocortex but not in the mouse. Pharmacological inhibition of PDGFD-PDGFR$β$ signalling in slice culture prevents normal cell cycle progression of neocortical RG in human, but not mouse.

With serial passage in vitro, wild-type postnatal cortical astroglia become progressively resistant to Dlx2-induced neuronal transdifferentiation. In contrast, the neurogenic competence of Ink4a/Arf-deficient astroglia is both greatly increased and does not diminish through serial cell culture passage. Electrophysiological analysis further demonstrates the neuronal identity of cells induced from Ink4a/Arf-null astroglia, and short hairpin RNA-mediated acute knockdown of p16Ink4a and p19Arf p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) indicates that these gene products function postnatally as a barrier to cellular transdifferentiation. Finally, we found that mouse fibroblasts deficient for Ink4a/Arf also exhibit greatly enhanced transcription factor-induced neuronal induction. These data indicate that Ink4a/Arf is a potent barrier to direct neuronal transdifferentiation and further suggest that this locus functions normally in the progressive developmental restriction of postnatal astrocytes.","tags":["Ink4a/Arf; astroglia; induced neuron; transcription factor; transdifferentiation"],"title":"The Ink4a/Arf locus is a barrier to direct neuronal transdifferentiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex A Pollen","Tomasz J Nowakowski","Joe Shuga","Xiaohui Wang","Anne A Leyrat","Jan H Lui","Nianzhen Li","Lukasz Szpankowski","Brian Fowler","Peilin Chen","Naveen Ramalingam","Gang Sun","Myo Thu","Michael Norris","Ronald Lebofsky","Dominique Toppani","2nd, Darnell W Kemp","Michael Wong","Barry Clerkson","Brittnee N Jones","Shiquan Wu","Lawrence Knutsson","Beatriz Alvarado","Jing Wang","Lesley S Weaver","Andrew P May","Robert C Jones","Marc A Unger","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Jay A A West"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1406851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406851200,"objectID":"4fb63314f44a96dba3e7360d6eeab1d9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/pollen-2014-ow/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.351795Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pollen-2014-ow/","section":"publication","summary":"Large-scale surveys of single-cell gene expression have the potential to reveal rare cell populations and lineage relationships but require efficient methods for cell capture and mRNA sequencing.

We then examined the human fetal cortex and found that a subset of human oRGs displayed similar characteristics, suggesting that diversity in oRG behavior may be a general feature. Similar to the human, ferret oRGs underwent multiple rounds of self-renewing divisions but were more likely to undergo symmetric divisions that expanded the oRG population, as opposed to producing intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs).

Rings form after fusion of the long and short arms of a chromosome, and are sometimes associated with large terminal deletions. Owing to the severity of these large aberrations that can affect multiple contiguous genes, no possible therapeutic strategies for ring chromosome disorders have been proposed. During cell division, ring chromosomes can exhibit unstable behaviour leading to continuous production of aneuploid progeny with low viability and high cellular death rate. The overall consequences of this chromosomal instability have been largely unexplored in experimental model systems. Here we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patient fibroblasts containing ring chromosomes with large deletions and found that reprogrammed cells lost the abnormal chromosome and duplicated the wild-type homologue through the compensatory uniparental disomy (UPD) mechanism. The karyotypically normal iPSCs with isodisomy for the corrected chromosome outgrew co-existing aneuploid populations, enabling rapid and efficient isolation of patient-derived iPSCs devoid of the original chromosomal aberration. Our results suggest a fundamentally different function for cellular reprogramming as a means of 'chromosome therapy' to reverse combined loss-of-function across many genes in cells with large-scale aberrations involving ring structures. In addition, our work provides an experimentally tractable human cellular system for studying mechanisms of chromosomal number control, which is of critical relevance to human development and disease.","tags":null,"title":"Cell-autonomous correction of ring chromosomes in human induced pluripotent stem cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qian Wu","Jing Liu","Ai Fang","Rui Li","Ye Bai","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD","Xiaoqun Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"d436245ce4d21ebeeaa3c97513222c32","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/wu-2014-hb/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.326239Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2014-hb/","section":"publication","summary":"Proper lamination of the cerebral cortex is precisely orchestrated, especially when neurons migrate from their place of birth to their final destination.

NKCC1 facilitates seizures because it renders GABA activity excitatory through intracellular Cl(-) accumulation, while blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide suppresses seizures. Bumetanide is currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of neonatal seizures. By blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide during cortical development, we found a critical period for the development of $α$-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate synapses. Disruption of GABA signaling during this window resulted in permanent decreases in excitatory synaptic transmission and sensorimotor gating deficits, a common feature in schizophrenia.

Gap junction adhesion has been shown to play an important mechanistic role in the radial migration of excitatory neurons. We asked whether a similar mechanism governs the tangential or radial migration of inhibitory interneurons. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx26 together with rescue experiments, we found that gap junctions are dispensable for the tangential migration of interneurons, but that Cx43 plays a role in the switch from tangential to radial migration that allows interneurons to enter the cortical plate and find their correct laminar position. Moreover this action is dependent on the adhesive properties and the C terminus of Cx43 but not the Cx43 channel. Thus, the radial phase of interneuron migration resembles that of excitatory neuron migration in terms of dependence on Cx43 adhesion.

These results indicate that gap junction adhesions are necessary for glial-guided neuronal migration, raising the possibility that the adhesive properties of gap junctions may have an important role in other physiological processes and diseases associated with gap junction function.","tags":null,"title":"Gap junction adhesion is necessary for radial migration in the neocortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1183248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1183248000,"objectID":"6bbf99915d9bb098da7b70da04cc0c30","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-2007-sz/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.945564Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-2007-sz/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cortical neurogenesis: transitioning from advances in the laboratory to cell-based therapies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen C Noctor","Verónica Martı́nez-Cerdeño","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1177977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177977600,"objectID":"c483e4650d14a335a8dca246cebb0177","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/noctor-2007-wh/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:47.939524Z","relpermalink":"/publication/noctor-2007-wh/","section":"publication","summary":"The mammalian cerebral cortex is the most cellularly complex structure in the animal kingdom.

Moreover, pyramidal neurons, once thought to migrate only along radial guide fibers to the developing layers of the cortex, have been shown to proceed through four distinct stages of migration during which they change shape, direction, and speed. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) inhibitory interneurons, on the other hand, are generated not in the cortex, but in the medial ganglionic eminence and migrate tangentially to their final cortical destinations. Evidence suggests that GABA activation may play a role in coordinating the generation and migration of both pyramidal and interneuron populations. At the end of neurogenesis, radial glial cells translocate to the cortex and transform into astrocytes. Although they do not actively divide in the adult brain, astrocytes may retain the potential to generate new neurons.

The mechanism underlying seizures with cortical malformations is still poorly understood. To study the physiology of dysplastic cortex, we developed an experimental model of CD. METHODS: Pregnant rats were given intraperitoneal injections of carmustine (1-3-bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea; BCNU) on embryonic day 15 (E15). Cortical histology was examined in the resulting pups at P0, P28, and P60. In addition, evoked and spontaneous field potential recordings were obtained in cortical slices from adult control and BCNU-exposed rats. Finally, we used whole-cell recordings to compare physiologic properties of pyramidal neurons and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in control and BCNU-treated animals. RESULTS: Features characteristic of CD were found in the offspring, including laminar disorganization, cytomegalic neurons, and neuronal heterotopias. Dysplastic cortex also contained abnormal clusters of Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells and disruption of radial glial fibers, as demonstrated with immunohistochemistry. Under conditions of partial GABAA-receptor blockade with 10 microM bicuculline methiodide (BMI), slices of dysplastic cortex demonstrated a significant increase in the number of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform discharges. Individual pyramidal neurons in dysplastic cortex were less sensitive to application of GABA compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: BCNU exposure in utero produces histologic alterations suggestive of CD in rat offspring. Dysplastic cortex from this model demonstrates features of hyperexcitability and decreased neuronal sensitivity to GABA. Such physiologic alterations may underlie the increased epileptogenicity of dysplastic cortex.","tags":null,"title":"Increased excitability and decreased sensitivity to GABA in an animal model of dysplastic cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David F Owens","Arnold R Kriegstein, MD, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1030838400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1030838400,"objectID":"3f5e282900dce21b12c9e4512d8aabc7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/owens-2002-oj/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.025383Z","relpermalink":"/publication/owens-2002-oj/","section":"publication","summary":"In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

The latter two cell classes have been assumed for some time to be distinct in both function and anatomy, but the cellular anatomy of the progenitor cell type has remained poorly defined. Several recent reports have raised doubts about the distinction between radial glial and precursor cells by demonstrating that radial glial cells are themselves neuronal progenitor cells (Malatesta et al., 2000; Hartfuss et al., 2001; Miyata et al., 2001; Noctor et al., 2001). This discovery raises the possibility that radial glia and the population of VZ progenitor cells may be one anatomical and functional cell class. Such a hypothesis predicts that throughout neurogenesis almost all mitotically active VZ cells and a substantial percentage of VZ cells overall are radial glia. We have therefore used various anatomical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological techniques to test these predictions. Our data demonstrate that the majority of VZ cells, and nearly all mitotically active VZ cells during neurogenesis, both have radial glial morphology and express radial glial markers. In addition, intracellular dye filling of electrophysiologically characterized progenitor cells in the VZ demonstrates that these cells have the morphology of radial glia. Because the vast majority cycling cells in the cortical VZ have characteristics of radial glia, the radial glial precursor cell may be responsible for both the production of newborn neurons and the guidance of daughter neurons to their destinations in the developing cortex.","tags":null,"title":"Dividing precursor cells of the embryonic cortical ventricular zone have morphological and molecular characteristics of radial glia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A R Kriegstein","D F Owens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":996624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":996624000,"objectID":"9bae6e6e02ddbb9fc9ef1ebf08ccf1b9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-2001-qw/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.034752Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-2001-qw/","section":"publication","summary":"Early in development, synapses with glycine or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels exhibit the ability to depolarize postsynaptic cells.

Radial glia are mitotically active throughout neurogenesis, and disappear or become astrocytes when neuronal migration is complete. Although the lineage relationships of cortical neurons and glia have been explored, the clonal relationship of radial glia to other cortical cells remains unknown. It has been suggested that radial glia may be neuronal precursors, but this has not been demonstrated in vivo.

Here we show that electrical stimulation of layer 1 results in a GABA(A)-mediated postsynaptic current (PSC) in pyramidal neurons. Gramicidin perforated patch recording demonstrates that the GABAergic layer 1 synapse is excitatory and can trigger action potentials in cortical neurons. In contrast to electrical stimulation, activation of intrinsic layer 1 neurons with a glutamate agonist fails to produce PSCs in pyramidal cells. In addition, responses can be evoked by stimulation of layer 1 at relatively large distances from the recording site. These findings are consistent with a contribution of the widely projecting incertocortical pathway, the only described GABAergic projection to neonatal cortex. Recording of identified neonatal incertocortical neurons reveals a population of active cells that exhibit high frequencies of spontaneous action potentials and are capable of robustly activating neonatal cortical neurons.

Proliferating precursor cells in the neocortical ventricular zone (VZ) express functional GABA(A) receptors as do immature postmigratory neurons in the developing cortical plate (CP); however, GABA(A) receptor properties in these distinct cell populations have not been compared. Using electrophysiological techniques in embryonic and early postnatal neocortex, we find that GABA(A) receptors expressed by VZ cells have a higher apparent affinity for GABA and are relatively insensitive to receptor desensitization compared with neurons in the CP. GABA-induced current magnitude increases with maturation with the smallest responses found in recordings from precursor cells in the VZ. No evidence was found that GABA(A) receptors on VZ cells are activated synaptically, consistent with previous data suggesting that these receptors are activated in a paracrine fashion by nonsynaptically released ligand. After neurons are born and migrate to the CP, they begin to demonstrate spontaneous synaptic activity, the majority of which is GABA(A) mediated. These spontaneous GABA(A) postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) first were detected at embryonic day 18 (E18). At birth, approximately 50% of recordings from cortical neurons demonstrated GABA(A)-mediated sPSCs, and this value increased with age. GABA(A)-mediated sPSCs were action potential dependent and arose from local GABAergic interneurons. GABA application could evoke action potential-dependent PSCs in neonatal cortical neurons, suggesting that during the first few postnatal days, GABA can act as an excitatory neurotransmitter. Finally, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- but not non-NMDA-mediated sPSCs were also present in early postnatal neurons. These events were not observed in cells voltage clamped at negative holding potentials (-60 to -70 mV) but were evident when the holding potential was set at positive values (+30 to +60 mV). Together these results provide evidence for the early maturation of GABAergic communication in the neocortex and a functional change in GABA(A)-receptor properties between precursor cells and early postmitotic neurons.

Whole cell patch-clamp and field-potential recordings in slices of somatosensory cortex from neonatal rats were used to study the development of IB cells and the development of 0 [Mg2+] oscillations. IB cells were not encountered before postnatal day 12 (P12) in layer 5, but from P13 to P19 an increasing proportion of cells had IB properties. Recordings from cells at P7, P17, and P19 in 0 [Mg2+] indicate that dramatic changes occur postnatally in 0 [Mg2+]-induced activity. At P7, cells largely showed trains of single action potentials. In contrast, at P19, cells showed organized bursts of rhythmic activity lasting 0.5-5 s separated by periods of relative quiescence. Cells recorded at P17 were found to have less organized rhythmic activity than cells from P19 cortex.

The specific role of clustering in cortical neurogenesis is unknown; however, clustering provides a means for spatially restricted local interactions between subsets of precursors and other cells within the VZ. In the present study, we have used a combination of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrDU) pulse labeling, intracellular biocytin labeling, and immunocytochemistry to determine when in the cell cycle VZ cells couple and uncouple from clusters and to determine what cell types within the VZ are coupled to clusters. Our results indicate that clusters contain radial glia and neural precursors but do not contain differentiating or migrating neurons. In early neurogenesis, all precursors in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle are coupled, and approximately half of the cells in G1 are coupled. In late neurogenesis, however, over half of the cells in both G1 and S phases are not coupled to VZ clusters, whereas all cells in G2 are coupled to clusters. Increased uncoupling in S phase during late neurogenesis may contribute to the greater percentage of VZ cells exiting the cell cycle at this time. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that pharmacologically uncoupling VZ cells with octanol decreases the percentage of VZ cells that enter S phase. These results demonstrate that cell clustering in the VZ is restricted to neural precursors and radial glia, is dynamic through the cell cycle, and may play a role in regulating neurogenesis.","tags":null,"title":"Cell coupling and uncoupling in the ventricular zone of developing neocortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A C Flint","A R Kriegstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":859852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":859852800,"objectID":"f2f5d9c140d82197841f548a3c5f656e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/flint-1997-is/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.077993Z","relpermalink":"/publication/flint-1997-is/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuronal migration disorders are often associated with intractable epilepsy.

The four modulatory NMDAR2A-D (NR2A-D) NMDA receptor subunits are known to alter NMDA receptor properties, and the expression of these subunits is regulated developmentally. It is unclear, however, how the four NR2 subunits are expressed in individual neurons and which NR2 subunits are important to the regulation of NMDA receptor properties during development in vivo. Analysis of NR2 subunit gene expression in single characterized neurons of postnatal neocortex revealed that cells expressing NR2A subunit mRNA had faster NMDAR EPSCs than cells not expressing this subunit, regardless of postnatal age. Expression of NR2A subunit mRNA in cortical neurons at even low levels seemed sufficient to alter the NMDA receptor time course.

Our results demonstrate that there is a progressive negative shift in EGABAA with the most positive values found in the youngest cortical precursor cells. At the early stages of neocortical development, EGABAA is determined by the chloride (Cl-) gradient, and the internal chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) decreases with development. EGABAA is positive to the resting potential, indicating that GABA serves to depolarize developing neocortical cells. Consistent with this conclusion, GABAA receptor activation with muscimol was found-to increase the internal calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in both embryonic and early postnatal neocortical cells through the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Postnatal cells exhibit spontaneous postsynaptic synaptic currents, which are eliminated by bicuculline methiodide (BMI) but not glutamate receptor antagonists and reverse at the Cl- equilibrium potential. Likewise, brief spontaneous increases in [Ca2+]i, sensitive to BMI and TTX, are observed at the same ages, suggesting that endogenous synaptic GABAA receptor activation can depolarize cells and activate VGCCs.

The properties of receptors for amino acid neurotransmitters expressed by developing cortical neurons were studied with the use of whole-cell recording in the intact cerebral cortex of embryonic turtles in vitro. The inhibitory agonist gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the excitatory agonist glutamate were focally applied to single cells under voltage clamp, and the ionic dependence, voltage dependence, and pharmacological sensitivity of the responses were characterized. The responses mediated by a glutamate receptor subtype, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, produced by glutamate and by evoked release of an endogenous excitatory agonist, were compared further. Fluctuation analysis was used to characterize the properties of the NMDA channels and the mechanism of action of receptor antagonists. 2. When postmitotic neurons first appeared at stage 15, all neurons tested responded to GABA with a current that reversed at the equilibrium potential for chloride ions and that was sensitive to the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI). As development proceeded, an increasing proportion of neurons also responded with a BMI-insensitive current that reversed near the equilibrium potential for potassium ions. This current was blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist 3-amino-2-propyl phosponic acid (phaclofen). The GABAB agonist baclofen, however, failed to produce a detectable postsynaptic current. 3. Neurons at stage 15 showed a biphasic response to glutamate that reversed at the equilibrium potential for cations. All neurons tested showed a slow, sustained response associated with an increase in current variance compared with background, and, as development proceeded, an increasing proportion also exhibited a fast, transient response. Both fast and slow responses varied linearly with voltage in the absence of Mg2+ ions, but the addition of Mg2+ ions to the bathing medium attenuated the slow response at hyperpolarized potentials. As a result, the current-voltage relation of the slow response in the presence of Mg2+ ions exhibited a region of negative slope conductance, like that of currents mediated by NMDA receptors. 4. The fast and slow responses to glutamate differed in their pharmacological sensitivity. The fast responses were sensitive to the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), whereas the slow responses were sensitive to the NMDA receptor antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV). 5.

Information concerning the timing and topography of neurotransmitter synthesis by specific classes of cortical neurons is important for understanding developmental roles of neurotransmitters and for identifying potential zones of neurotransmitter action in the developing brain. We therefore analyzed the appearance of GABA and glutamate in the cerebral cortex of embryonic turtles using polyclonal antisera raised against GABA and glutamate. Neuronal subtypes become immunoreactive for the putative amino acid neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate early in the embryonic development of turtle cerebral cortex, with nonpyramidal cells immunoreactive for GABA and pyramidal cells immunoreactive for glutamate. The results of controls strongly suggest that the immunocytochemical staining in tissue sections by the GABA and glutamate antisera corresponds to fixed endogenous GABA and glutamate. Horizontally oriented cells in the early marginal zone (stages 15-16) that are GABA-immunoreactive (GABA-IR) resemble nonpyramidal cells in morphology and distribution. GABA-IR neurons exhibit increasingly diverse morphologies and become distributed in all cortical layers as the cortex matures. Glutamate-immunoreactive (Glu-IR) cells dominate the cellular layer throughout development and are also common in the subcellular layer at early stages, a distribution like that of pyramidal neurons and distinct from that of GABA-IR nonpyramidal cells. The early organization of embryonic turtle cortex in reptiles resembles that of embryonic mammalian cortex, and the immunocytochemical results underline several shared as well as distinguishing features. Early GABA-IR nonpyramidal cells flank the developing cortical plate, composed primarily of pyramidal cells, shown here to be Glu-IR. The earliest GABA-IR cells in turtles likely correspond to Cajal-Retzius cells, a ubiquitous and precocious cell type in vertebrate cortex. Glutamate-IR projection neurons in vertebrates may also be related. The distinctly different topographies of GABA and glutamate containing cells in reptiles and mammals indicate that even if the basic amino acid transmitter-containing cell types are conserved in higher vertebrates, the local interactions mediated by these transmitters may differ. The potential role of GABA and glutamate in nonsynaptic interactions early in cortical development is reinforced by the precocious expression of these neurotransmitters in turtles, well before they are required for synaptic transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","tags":null,"title":"Appearance of putative amino acid neurotransmitters during differentiation of neurons in embryonic turtle cerebral cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M G Blanton","A R Kriegstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":681004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":681004800,"objectID":"f9de36764eae228e290e9c69abf59fd6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/blanton-1991-at/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.115443Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blanton-1991-at/","section":"publication","summary":"As a starting point for understanding the development of the cerebral cortex in reptiles and for determining how reptilian cortical development compares to that in other vertebrate classes, we studied the appearance and morphological differentiation of cerebral cortical neurons in embryonic turtles. 3H-thymidine birthdate labeling and focal injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in in vitro cortical slices revealed that replicating cells occupy the outer ventricular zone, and subsequently migrate to the ventricular surface where they divide. Postmitotic neurons begin differentiating and elaborating neurites while migrating back through the ventricular zone. On their arrival at the top of the ventricular zone, pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons can be distinguished morphologically. Cells with multipolar apical dendritic tufts ascending in the marginal zone resemble immature pyramidal neurons. Neurons morphologically similar to these early pyramidal cells were retrogradely labeled by injections of the lipophilic tracer 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate (diI) in a known pyramidal cell target, the thalamus. Nonpyramidal neurons, resembling Cajal-Retzius cells, had horizontally oriented long axons and dendrites coursing in the plexiform primordium, the future marginal zone. With further development morphological differences between cell types became accentuated, and pyramidal cell somata were segregated into a single cellular layer flanked by zones containing predominantly nonpyramidal cells. Axon elaboration occurred early in embryonic development, as pyramidal cells sent axonal branches to the septum, thalamus, and cortical targets soon after their generation, and the intracortical axonal plexus became increasingly dense during embryonic life. Over a similar time course the distribution of projecting neurons labeled by thalamic diI injections changed from an initial homogeneous distribution to a preferential location in the superficial half of the cellular layer. Results from this study demonstrate several features of cortical differentiation that are conserved in reptiles and mammals, including similar early morphological differentiation events, the early distinction of principal cell types, and the parallel development of pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons. The context in which these similar developmental events occur, however, differs profoundly in reptiles and mammals, with differences in the timing and location of neurite elaboration and differences in the appearance and architectonic organization of the cortex. Comparison of cortical developmental patterns between reptiles and mammals shows that similar functional cortical circuits with balanced excitation and inhibition can emerge in diverse cortical structures.","tags":null,"title":"Morphological differentiation of distinct neuronal classes in embryonic turtle cerebral cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J J Lo Turco","A R Kriegstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":670464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":670464000,"objectID":"37b66f10b4602def6c933aee468b7c55","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/lo-turco-1991-bz/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.112232Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lo-turco-1991-bz/","section":"publication","summary":"The neocortex of the brain develops from a simple germinal layer into a complex multilayer structure.

Remarkably, these neurons survive 5 minute exposures to glutamate in concentrations up to 3 mM, doses 30 times the LD50 and 6 times the LD100 for mouse cortical neurons. Elucidating the mechanism for this resistance may suggest new strategies for brain protection.","tags":null,"title":"Turtle cortical neurons survive glutamate exposures that are lethal to mammalian neurons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M G Blanton","J J Lo Turco","A R Kriegstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":654739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":654739200,"objectID":"bbfad76befee1f02d83872d89d3babbd","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/blanton-1990-pg/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.307683Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blanton-1990-pg/","section":"publication","summary":"Before synapses form in embryonic turtle cerebral cortex, an endogenous neurotransmitter activates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels on neurons in the cortical plate.

The developmental increase in rate of rise of the action potential suggests an increasing density of voltage-dependent Na+-channels are inserted in neuronal membranes during postnatal development. The higher input resistance of young cells might be due to their small size and differences in membrane properties. The long time constant indicates a higher specific membrane resistivity of immature neurons. Postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) recorded in young neurons were longer in latency, longer in duration, and more fragile during repetitive activation than their mature counterparts. In addition, PSPs evoked in neurons of animals less than 1 week old did not contain inhibitory postsynaptic components. These physiological features of immature neocortical neurons help explain the pattern of epileptogenesis in young animals. When neonatal cortical slices were exposed to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists penicillin or bicuculline, the frequency of occurrence of discharges resembling epileptiform depolarization shifts approached that found in mature slices only during the second postnatal week.

The turtle dorsal cortex has been identified as a favorable physiological preparation that may bear a phylogenetic relationship to mammalian neocortex. While anatomical studies have likened the reptilian medial cortical region to mammalian hippocampus, its physiological properties have not been explored. We therefore used intracellular and extracellular recording techniques to examine the cellular and synaptic physiology of turtle ``hippocampal'' or medial cortex. Turtle medial cortex contains two principal classes of neurons, pyramidal cells and stellate neurons. Recordings with Lucifer yellow CH (LY)-filled microelectrodes allowed us to correlate the physiological properties of medial cortical neurons with their cellular morphology. Pyramidal neurons were situated in a single cellular layer and had spiny apical dendrites extending into the molecular layer. These cells fired relatively long-duration action potentials (APs) and showed frequency adaptation to suprathreshold current pulse injections. Stellate cells were usually found in the subcellular and molecular layers and had aspiny dendrites. In contrast to pyramidal cells, they fired brief APs and displayed no frequency adaptation. A discrete population of cells in the dorsal portion of medial cortex (DMC) was capable of bursting endogenously or in response to synaptic activation. Bursts usually contained an underlying slow depolarization and often occurred at regular intervals. Intracellular LY injections confirmed that these cells were pyramidal in morphology. Electrical stimulation of afferent fibers revealed that pyramidal cells and stellate neurons differed in their synaptic responses. In ventral medial cortex (VMC), afferent stimulation evoked a multiphasic response in most pyramidal cells, whereas stellate cells were synaptically excited. Orthodromic activation of DMC bursting cells resulted in a powerful excitation--often a short burst--and subsequent inhibition. Stellate neurons in DMC also had a biphasic synaptic response consisting of both an early excitation and a late inhibition. Experiments using intracellular chloride (Cl-) injection or focal bicuculline application suggested that part of the inhibitory component of the pyramidal cell synaptic response was dependent on a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated increase in Cl- conductance.

Intracellular recordings suggested two distinct classes of neuronal behavior. Cell labeling with either Lucifer Yellow or horseradish peroxidase revealed that these behaviors correlated with the two morphological classes of cortical neurons: pyramidal cells and stellate cells. Examination of Golgi-stained neurons of dorsal cortex did not uncover any other obvious classes. Pyramidal cells had their somata in the cell layer, and extended several densely spined apical dendrites through the molecular layer to the pia. They also had spiny basilar dendrites directed through the subcellular layer toward the ependymal border. Physiologically, pyramidal cells had relatively prolonged action potentials that showed marked frequency adaptation during a sustained suprathreshold current pulse. Their most striking characteristic was a tendency to fire two discrete sizes of action potential, one small (mean = 34 mV) and of relatively low threshold, the other large (mean = 76 mV) and of higher threshold. We hypothesize that at least some small spikes arise from distal dendritic sites, whereas large spikes are somatically generated. Both spikes were tetrodotoxin-sensitive, although calcium-dependent electrogenesis occurred when potassium channels were blocked. In contrast to pyramidal cells, the somata of stellate cells were found in the molecular and subcellular zones. Their dendrites tended to be horizontally oriented and spine-free. Stellate cells had relatively brief action potentials, each of which was followed by a large but short-lasting undershoot of membrane potential. Stellate cells showed little or no spike frequency adaptation. Spike amplitudes were always relatively uniform and large (mean = 73 mV). Thus, in the dorsal cortex of turtles, the pyramidal cells, which are projection neurons, and stellate cells, which are local GABAergic inhibitory neurons, have distinctly different membrane characteristics. The physiological properties of the two types of turtle cortical neurons are very similar to their counterparts in cortical structures of the mammalian telencephalon.","tags":null,"title":"Cellular physiology of the turtle visual cortex: distinctive properties of pyramidal and stellate neurons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A R Kriegstein","B W Connors"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":504921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":504921600,"objectID":"80d0ccbf6da7a66aca53307cb01d28ea","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-1986-rp/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.341102Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-1986-rp/","section":"publication","summary":"We have examined the synaptic physiology of the isolated dorsal cortex of the turtle, Pseudemys scripta elegans. Electrical stimulation of afferent pathways elicited distinct, stereotyped responses in pyramidal and stellate neurons. Single shocks evoked a long-lasting barrage of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in stellate cells, and led to a burst of several action potentials. Under the same circumstances, pyramidal cells displayed a small amount of short-latency excitation, but this was accompanied by a profound and prolonged set of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). Synaptic excitation of the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells could evoke dendritic action potentials that were visible at the soma as small all-or-none spikes rising from the hyperpolarized level of the IPSP. There appeared to be two mechanistically different types of IPSPs in pyramidal cells. The first occurred at short latency, could produce a very large conductance increase, reversed polarity at -71 mV, and was chloride-dependent. The second was generally smaller and more protracted, had a relatively negative reversal potential of -85 to -95 mV, and was insensitive to chloride injection. Focal application of small doses of the putative inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) onto the somata of pyramidal cells caused a conductance increase and hyperpolarization. This response had features in common with the short-latency IPSP, including an identical reversal potential. Application of large doses of GABA to the somata of pyramidal cells or smaller doses to their dendrites elicited multiphasic or purely depolarizing responses that were at least partly due to time- or space-dependent shifts of the equilibrium potential of the response. Bicuculline methiodide, a potent GABA antagonist, depressed both the responses to GABA and the short-latency IPSP, but not the long-latency IPSP; synchronized epileptiform burst discharges also resulted. These findings, together with responses to locally applied electric shocks and the excitatory amino acid glutamate, suggested that inhibition of pyramidal cells was generated intrinsically by stellate cells, and that the cortical circuit provides pathways for both feedforward and feedback GABAergic inhibition. The data also suggest that pyramidal cells are mutually excitatory. These features are similar to the basic intrinsic circuitry in the telencephalic cortices of mammals.","tags":null,"title":"Cellular physiology of the turtle visual cortex: synaptic properties and intrinsic circuitry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Suppes","A R Kriegstein","D A Prince"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":476064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":476064000,"objectID":"956a5c44e0a20f33fb2693e310178dd8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/suppes-1985-pm/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.399718Z","relpermalink":"/publication/suppes-1985-pm/","section":"publication","summary":"Dopamine (DA) application to guinea pig hippocampal CA1 neurons in vitro causes hyperpolarization of the resting potential, increase in conductance, and increase in amplitude and duration of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP).

These results suggest that the actions of acetylcholine to increase membrane excitability interact with penicillin-induced disinhibition to enhance hippocampal epileptogenesis.","tags":null,"title":"Cholinergic enhancement of penicillin-induced epileptiform discharges in pyramidal neurons of the guinea pig hippocampus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A R Kriegstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":402278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":402278400,"objectID":"110861468ae16d05dd2df88c8bf326bc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-1982-sq/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.409084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-1982-sq/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Neurology-important advances in clinical medicine: treatment of febrile convulsions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A R Kriegstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":223603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":223603200,"objectID":"1dbe2f26d66c34a05ebeaa51b6ab5732","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-1977-bg/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.548735Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-1977-bg/","section":"publication","summary":"In order to study the development of the nervous system of the marine mollusc, Aplysia californica, it is necessary objectively to assess the maturity of individual specimens. This can be done by defining stages in the life cycle. The post-hatching development can be divided into four phases: planktonic, metamorphic, juvenile, and adult. These phases can be further subdivided into 13 stages on the basis of behavioral and morphological characteristics visible in living specimens: Stage 1, newly hatched; Stage 2, eyes develop; Stage 3, the larval heart beats; Stage 4, maximum shell size is reached; Stage 5, the propodium develops; Stage 6, red spots appear; Stage 7, the velum is shed; Stage 8, eyebrows appear; Stage 9, pink color develops; Stage 10, white spots appear; Stage 11, rhinophores grow; Stage 12, the genital groove forms; Stage 13, egg laying begins. Reconstructions from serial sections taken from specimens fixed at each of these stages reveal the sequence of formation of the major organ systems. The nervous system develops gradually. The cerebral and pedal ganglia are present at Stage 1, the optic ganglia develop at Stage 2, the abdominal, pleural, and osphradial ganglia at Stage 3, the buccal ganglia at Stage 5, and the genital ganglion at Stage 13. Because Aplysia develops gradually, it is possible to analyze the contribution which gastropod torsion makes to the different phases of the life cycle. The Aplysia embryo undergoes 120 degrees torsion prior to Stage 1. The major visceral organs, the digestive system, heart, gill, and visceral nervous system, develop sybsequently in their post-torsional positions. After metamorphosis, there is a partial de-torsion which involves only the digestive system. Torsion of the digestive system may therefore be beneficial only to the pre-metamorphic larva, and not to the postmetamorphic juvenile.","tags":null,"title":"Stages in the post-hatching development of Aplysia californica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A R Kriegstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":220924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":220924800,"objectID":"521fc81cb03e01c312dc5469374eff89","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-1977-vv/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.552282Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-1977-vv/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to grow the marine molluse Aplysia under laboratory conditions allows a detailed study of the formation of the nervous system and of the development of specific identified cells. I have found that the ganglia develop in a specific temporal order. Cerebral and pedal ganglia develop at hatching, the abdominal, pleural, and osphradial ganglia 3 weeks after hatching, and the buccal ganglia at 4 weeks. The origin of the abdominal ganglion is complex; its anlage forms at 3 weeks from three larval ganglia that fuse to form the abdominal ganglion. Individual cells cannot be distinguished from one another by their location within the ganglion or by their appearance alone until metamorphosis at 5 weeks. After metamorphosis, the identified neuron, R2, suddenly becomes recognizable because of a significant increase in its size.","tags":null,"title":"Development of the nervous system of Aplysia californica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A R Kriegstein","V Castellucci","E R Kandel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":147225600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":147225600,"objectID":"4ec91b8b28ddeed190b2c3778f5f95c5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kriegstein-1974-xu/","publishdate":"2023-04-26T19:37:48.555668Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kriegstein-1974-xu/","section":"publication","summary":"To utilize the advantages offered by the large identified nerve cells of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica for cellular biological studies of development, we have devised simple techniques for growing this species in the laboratory in large number with a generation time as short as nineteen weeks. We have used the cultured animals to study the life cycle from fertilized egg to reproductive adult. The major developmental and behavioral changes occur at metamorphosis, when the larvae settle on the seaweed Laurencia pacifica and the locomotor and feeding behaviors are transformed into their adult forms. We have examined the timetable for the abandonment of larval behaviors and the emergence of adult ones and found that the transition from swimming to crawling occurs first and marks the onset of metamorphosis. The change from ciliary feeding to radular feeding occurs later and signals the end of metamorphosis. Other adult behaviors, such as the reflex responses and fixed-action patterns of the mantle organs, appear after metamorphosis.","tags":null,"title":"Metamorphosis of Aplysia californica in laboratory culture","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Dates Name Program or School Mentor Type Role Current Position 1983 - 1987 Janet M.
