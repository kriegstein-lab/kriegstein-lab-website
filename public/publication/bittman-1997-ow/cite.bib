 abstract = {Cells within the ventricular zone (VZ) of developing neocortex
are coupled together into clusters by gap junction channels. The
specific role of clustering in cortical neurogenesis is unknown;
however, clustering provides a means for spatially restricted
local interactions between subsets of precursors and other cells
within the VZ. In the present study, we have used a combination
of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrDU) pulse labeling, intracellular
biocytin labeling, and immunocytochemistry to determine when in
the cell cycle VZ cells couple and uncouple from clusters and to
determine what cell types within the VZ are coupled to clusters.
Our results indicate that clusters contain radial glia and neural
precursors but do not contain differentiating or migrating
neurons. In early neurogenesis, all precursors in S and G2 phases
of the cell cycle are coupled, and approximately half of the
cells in G1 are coupled. In late neurogenesis, however, over half
of the cells in both G1 and S phases are not coupled to VZ
clusters, whereas all cells in G2 are coupled to clusters.
Increased uncoupling in S phase during late neurogenesis may
contribute to the greater percentage of VZ cells exiting the cell
cycle at this time. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found
that pharmacologically uncoupling VZ cells with octanol decreases
the percentage of VZ cells that enter S phase. These results
demonstrate that cell clustering in the VZ is restricted to
neural precursors and radial glia, is dynamic through the cell
cycle, and may play a role in regulating neurogenesis.},
