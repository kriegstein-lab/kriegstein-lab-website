 abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput methods for profiling the
transcriptomes of single cells have recently emerged as
transformative approaches for large-scale population surveys of
cellular diversity in heterogeneous primary tissues. However, the
efficient generation of such atlases will depend on sufficient
sampling of diverse cell types while remaining cost-effective to
enable a comprehensive examination of organs, developmental
stages, and individuals. RESULTS: To examine the relationship
between sampled cell numbers and transcriptional heterogeneity in
the context of unbiased cell type classification, we explored the
population structure of a publicly available 1.3 million cell
dataset from E18.5 mouse brain and validated our findings in
published data from adult mice. We propose a computational
framework for inferring the saturation point of cluster discovery
in a single-cell mRNA-seq experiment, centered around cluster
preservation in downsampled datasets. In addition, we introduce a
``complexity index,'' which characterizes the heterogeneity of
cells in a given dataset. Using Cajal-Retzius cells as an example
of a limited complexity dataset, we explored whether the detected
biological distinctions relate to technical clustering.
Surprisingly, we found that clustering distinctions carrying
biologically interpretable meaning are achieved with far fewer
cells than the originally sampled, though technical saturation of
rare populations such as Cajal-Retzius cells is not achieved. We
additionally validated these findings with a recently published
atlas of cell types across mouse organs and again find using
subsampling that a much smaller number of cells recapitulates the
cluster distinctions of the complete dataset. CONCLUSIONS:
Together, these findings suggest that most of the biologically
interpretable cell types from the 1.3 million cell database can
be recapitulated by analyzing 50,000 randomly selected cells,
indicating that instead of profiling few individuals at high
``cellular coverage,'' cell atlas studies may instead benefit
from profiling more individuals, or many time points at lower
cellular coverage and then further enriching for populations of
interest. This strategy is ideal for scenarios where cost and
time are limited, though extremely rare populations of interest
(&lt; 1%) may be identifiable only with much higher cell numbers.},
