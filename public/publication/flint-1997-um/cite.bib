 abstract = {One form of rhythmic activity intrinsic to neocortex can be
induced in slices of adult somatosensory cortex by lowering
[Mg2+]o to unblock N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) receptors. It has
been suggested that a population of intrinsically burst-firing
(IB) neurons that are unique to cortical layer 5 may play a role
in the rhythmic activity seen under these conditions. Whole cell
patch-clamp and field-potential recordings in slices of
somatosensory cortex from neonatal rats were used to study the
development of IB cells and the development of 0 [Mg2+]
oscillations. IB cells were not encountered before postnatal day
12 (P12) in layer 5, but from P13 to P19 an increasing proportion
of cells had IB properties. Recordings from cells at P7, P17, and
P19 in 0 [Mg2+] indicate that dramatic changes occur postnatally
in 0 [Mg2+]-induced activity. At P7, cells largely showed trains
of single action potentials. In contrast, at P19, cells showed
organized bursts of rhythmic activity lasting 0.5-5 s separated
by periods of relative quiescence. Cells recorded at P17 were
found to have less organized rhythmic activity than cells from
P19 cortex. Field-potential recordings in 0 [Mg2+] made at P7
showed infrequent and slowly occurring field depolarizations,
whereas field-potential recordings at P19 consisted of
spontaneous bursts of 4-12 Hz oscillations identical to those
observed in the adult. Application of NE, which inhibits
burst-firing of layer 5 IB cells, significantly altered the
discharge pattern of 0 [Mg2+] oscillations at P19. These data
suggest that the maturation of one type of rhythmic network
activity intrinsic to neocortex is influenced by the development
of the membrane properties of a single cell type.},
