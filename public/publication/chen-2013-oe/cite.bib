 abstract = {The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) is an embryonic forebrain
structure that generates the majority of cortical interneurons.
MGE transplantation into specific regions of the postnatal
central nervous system modifies circuit function and improves
deficits in mouse models of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, pain,
and phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits. Herein, we describe
approaches to generate MGE-like progenitor cells from mouse
embryonic stem (ES) cells. Using a modified embryoid body method,
we provided gene expression evidence that mouse ES-derived
Lhx6(+) cells closely resemble immature interneurons generated
from authentic MGE-derived Lhx6(+) cells. We hypothesized that
enhancers that are active in the mouse MGE would be useful tools
in detecting when ES cells differentiate into MGE cells. Here we
demonstrate the utility of enhancer elements [422 (DlxI12b),
Lhx6, 692, 1056, and 1538] as tools to mark MGE-like cells in ES
cell differentiation experiments. We found that enhancers
DlxI12b, 692, and 1538 are active in Lhx6-GFP(+) cells, while
enhancer 1056 is active in Olig2(+) cells. These data demonstrate
unique techniques to follow and purify MGE-like derivatives from
ES cells, including GABAergic cortical interneurons and
oligodendrocytes, for use in stem cell-based therapeutic assays
and treatments.},
