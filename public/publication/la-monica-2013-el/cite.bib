 abstract = {The human neocortex is increased in size and complexity as
compared with most other species. Neocortical expansion has
recently been attributed to protracted neurogenesis by outer
radial glial cells in the outer subventricular zone, a region
present in humans but not in rodents. The mechanisms of human
outer radial glial cell generation are unknown, but are proposed
to involve division of ventricular radial glial cells; neural
stem cells present in all developing mammals. Here we show that
human ventricular radial glial cells produce outer radial glial
cells and seed formation of the outer subventricular zone via
horizontal divisions, which occur more frequently in humans than
in rodents. We further find that outer radial glial cell mitotic
behaviour is cell intrinsic, and that the basal fibre, inherited
by outer radial glial cells after ventricular radial glial
division, determines cleavage angle. Our results suggest that
altered regulation of mitotic spindle orientation increased outer
radial glial cell number, and ultimately neuronal number, during
human brain evolution.},
