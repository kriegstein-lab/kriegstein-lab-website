 abstract = {Cell-cell signaling within the neocortical ventricular zone (VZ)
has been shown to influence the proliferation of VZ precursor
cells and the subsequent differentiation and fate of postmitotic
neurons. Calcium (Ca(2+)), a ubiquitous second messenger
implicated in the regulation of many aspects of development, may
play a role in these signaling events. Accordingly, we have
examined the spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneous intracellular
free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) fluctuations of cells within the intact
neocortical VZ. Previous observations have demonstrated that
similar patterns of spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) increase occur in
both proliferative and postmitotic cortical cells, suggesting
that they may be mechanistically similar. Our results suggest
that the changes in [Ca(2+)](i) in VZ cells and cortical plate
neurons are likely triggered by different mechansims, and imply
that similar changes in [Ca(2+)](i) may underlie different
signaling events during distinct phases of neocortical
development.},
