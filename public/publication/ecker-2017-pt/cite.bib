 abstract = {A comprehensive characterization of neuronal cell types, their
distributions, and patterns of connectivity is critical for
understanding the properties of neural circuits and how they
generate behaviors. Here we review the experiences of the BRAIN
Initiative Cell Census Consortium, ten pilot projects funded by
the U.S. BRAIN Initiative, in developing, validating, and scaling
up emerging genomic and anatomical mapping technologies for
creating a complete inventory of neuronal cell types and their
connections in multiple species and during development. These
projects lay the foundation for a larger and longer-term effort
to generate whole-brain cell atlases in species including mice
and humans.},
