 abstract = {Classical lissencephaly is a genetic neurological disorder
associated with mental retardation and intractable epilepsy, and
Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is the most severe form of the
disease. In this study, to investigate the effects of MDS on
human progenitor subtypes that control neuronal output and
influence brain topology, we analyzed cerebral organoids derived
from control and MDS-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using
time-lapse imaging, immunostaining, and single-cell RNA
sequencing. We saw a cell migration defect that was rescued when
we corrected the MDS causative chromosomal deletion and severe
apoptosis of the founder neuroepithelial stem cells, accompanied
by increased horizontal cell divisions. We also identified a
mitotic defect in outer radial glia, a progenitor subtype that is
largely absent from lissencephalic rodents but critical for human
neocortical expansion. Our study, therefore, deepens our
understanding of MDS cellular pathogenesis and highlights the
broad utility of cerebral organoids for modeling human
neurodevelopmental disorders.},
