 abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many cellular events during brain
development by interacting with hundreds of mRNA transcripts.
However, miRNAs operate nonuniformly upon the transcriptional
profile with an as yet unknown logic. Shortcomings in defining
miRNA-mRNA networks include limited knowledge of in vivo miRNA
targets and their abundance in single cells. By combining
multiple complementary approaches, high-throughput sequencing of
RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation with an
antibody to AGO2 (AGO2-HITS-CLIP), single-cell profiling and
computational analyses using bipartite and coexpression networks,
we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate as functional
modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo
dynamic transitions during brain development. These networks are
highly dynamic during development and over the course of
evolution. One such interaction is between radial-glia-enriched
ORC4 and miR-2115, a great-ape-specific miRNA, which appears to
control radial glia proliferation rates during human brain
development.},
