 abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse and poorly conserved
category of transcripts that have expanded greatly in primates,
particularly in the brain. We identified an lncRNA, which has
acquired 16 microRNA response elements for miR-143-3p in the
Catarrhini branch of primates. This lncRNA, termed LncND
(neurodevelopment), is expressed in neural progenitor cells and
then declines in neurons. Binding and release of miR-143-3p by
LncND control the expression of Notch receptors. LncND expression
is enriched in radial glia cells (RGCs) in the ventricular and
subventricular zones of developing human brain. Downregulation in
neuroblastoma cells reduced cell proliferation and induced
neuronal differentiation, an effect phenocopied by miR-143-3p
overexpression. Gain of function of LncND in developing mouse
cortex led to an expansion of PAX6+ RGCs. These findings support
a role for LncND in miRNA-mediated regulation of Notch signaling
within the neural progenitor pool in primates that may have
contributed to the expansion of cerebral cortex.},
