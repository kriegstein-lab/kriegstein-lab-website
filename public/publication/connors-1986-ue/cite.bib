 abstract = {The electrophysiological properties of neurons in the
three-layered dorsal cortex of the turtle, Pseudemys scripta
elegans, have been studied in vitro. Intracellular recordings
suggested two distinct classes of neuronal behavior. Cell
labeling with either Lucifer Yellow or horseradish peroxidase
revealed that these behaviors correlated with the two
morphological classes of cortical neurons: pyramidal cells and
stellate cells. Examination of Golgi-stained neurons of dorsal
cortex did not uncover any other obvious classes. Pyramidal cells
had their somata in the cell layer, and extended several densely
spined apical dendrites through the molecular layer to the pia.
They also had spiny basilar dendrites directed through the
subcellular layer toward the ependymal border. Physiologically,
pyramidal cells had relatively prolonged action potentials that
showed marked frequency adaptation during a sustained
suprathreshold current pulse. Their most striking characteristic
was a tendency to fire two discrete sizes of action potential,
one small (mean = 34 mV) and of relatively low threshold, the
other large (mean = 76 mV) and of higher threshold. We
hypothesize that at least some small spikes arise from distal
dendritic sites, whereas large spikes are somatically generated.
Both spikes were tetrodotoxin-sensitive, although
calcium-dependent electrogenesis occurred when potassium channels
were blocked. In contrast to pyramidal cells, the somata of
stellate cells were found in the molecular and subcellular zones.
Their dendrites tended to be horizontally oriented and
spine-free. Stellate cells had relatively brief action
potentials, each of which was followed by a large but
short-lasting undershoot of membrane potential. Stellate cells
showed little or no spike frequency adaptation. Spike amplitudes
were always relatively uniform and large (mean = 73 mV). Thus, in
the dorsal cortex of turtles, the pyramidal cells, which are
projection neurons, and stellate cells, which are local GABAergic
inhibitory neurons, have distinctly different membrane
characteristics. The physiological properties of the two types of
turtle cortical neurons are very similar to their counterparts in
cortical structures of the mammalian telencephalon.},
