 abstract = {Studies of the spatiotemporal, transcriptomic, and morphological
diversity of radial glia (RG) have spurred our current models of
human corticogenesis. In the developing cortex, neural
intermediate progenitor cells (nIPCs) are a neuron-producing
transit-amplifying cell type born in the germinal zones of the
cortex from RG. The potential diversity of the nIPC population,
that produces a significant portion of excitatory cortical
neurons, is understudied, particularly in the developing human
brain. Here we explore the spatiotemporal, transcriptomic, and
morphological variation that exists within the human nIPC
population and provide a resource for future studies. We observe
that the spatial distribution of nIPCs in the cortex changes
abruptly around gestational week (GW) 19/20, marking a distinct
shift in cellular distribution and organization during late
neurogenesis. We also identify five transcriptomic subtypes, one
of which appears at this spatiotemporal transition. Finally, we
observe a diversity of nIPC morphologies that do not correlate
with specific transcriptomic subtypes. These results provide an
analysis of the spatiotemporal, transcriptional, and
morphological diversity of nIPCs in developing brain tissue and
provide an atlas of nIPC subtypes in the developing human cortex
that can benchmark in vitro models of human development such as
cerebral organoids and help inform future studies of how nIPCs
contribute to cortical neurogenesis.},
