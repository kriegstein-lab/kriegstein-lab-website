 abstract = {Directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) has seen significant progress in recent years. However,
most differentiated populations exhibit immature properties of an
early embryonic stage, raising concerns about their ability to
model and treat disease. Here, we report the directed
differentiation of hPSCs into medial ganglionic eminence
(MGE)-like progenitors and their maturation into forebrain type
interneurons. We find that early-stage progenitors progress via a
radial glial-like stem cell enriched in the human fetal brain.
Both in vitro and posttransplantation into the rodent cortex, the
MGE-like cells develop into GABAergic interneuron subtypes with
mature physiological properties along a prolonged intrinsic
timeline of up to 7 months, mimicking endogenous human neural
development. MGE-derived cortical interneuron deficiencies are
implicated in a broad range of neurodevelopmental and
degenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of these
results for modeling human neural development and disease.},
