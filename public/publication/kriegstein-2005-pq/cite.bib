 abstract = {Our knowledge of the proliferation, migration, and
differentiation of neurons has changed dramatically over the last
10 years. Whereas traditionally it was thought that glial and
neuronal cells were separate cell lines with different lineages,
we now know that this is not true. Radial glia are a type of
neural stem cell that generate excitatory pyramidal neurons
directly through asymmetric cell division in the ventricular zone
(VZ) of the telencephalon and indirectly through the symmetric
division of daughter intermediate precursor cells that divide in
the subventricular zone (SVZ). Moreover, pyramidal neurons, once
thought to migrate only along radial guide fibers to the
developing layers of the cortex, have been shown to proceed
through four distinct stages of migration during which they
change shape, direction, and speed. Gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABAergic) inhibitory interneurons, on the other hand, are
generated not in the cortex, but in the medial ganglionic
eminence and migrate tangentially to their final cortical
destinations. Evidence suggests that GABA activation may play a
role in coordinating the generation and migration of both
pyramidal and interneuron populations. At the end of
neurogenesis, radial glial cells translocate to the cortex and
transform into astrocytes. Although they do not actively divide
in the adult brain, astrocytes may retain the potential to
generate new neurons. These new findings have increased our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying certain developmental
disorders and, in doing so, reveal potentially useful modes of
therapeutic intervention.},
