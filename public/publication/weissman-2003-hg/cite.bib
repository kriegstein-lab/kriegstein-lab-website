 abstract = {Radial glial cells play at least two crucial roles in cortical
development: neuronal production in the ventricular zone (VZ) and
the subsequent guidance of neuronal migration. There is evidence
that radial glia-like cells are present not only during
development but in the adult mammalian brain as well. In
addition, radial glial cells appear to be neurogenic in the
central nervous system of a number of vertebrate species. We
demonstrate here that most dividing progenitor cells in the
embryonic human VZ express radial glial proteins. Furthermore, we
provide evidence that radial glial cells maintain a
vimentin-positive radial fiber throughout each stage of cell
division. Asymmetric inheritance of this fiber may be an
important factor in determining how neuronal progeny will migrate
into the developing cortical plate. Although radial glial cells
have traditionally been characterized by their role in guiding
migration, their role as neuronal progenitors may represent their
defining characteristic throughout the vertebrate CNS.},
