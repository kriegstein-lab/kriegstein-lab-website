 abstract = {GABAergic cortical interneurons underlie the complexity of neural
circuits and are particularly numerous and diverse in humans. In
rodents, cortical interneurons originate in the subpallial
ganglionic eminences, but their developmental origins in humans
are controversial. We characterized the developing human
ganglionic eminences and found that the subventricular zone (SVZ)
expanded massively during the early second trimester, becoming
densely populated with neural stem cells and intermediate
progenitor cells. In contrast with the cortex, most stem cells in
the ganglionic eminence SVZ did not maintain radial fibers or
orientation. The medial ganglionic eminence exhibited unique
patterns of progenitor cell organization and clustering, and
markers revealed that the caudal ganglionic eminence generated a
greater proportion of cortical interneurons in humans than in
rodents. On the basis of labeling of newborn neurons in slice
culture and mapping of proliferating interneuron progenitors, we
conclude that the vast majority of human cortical interneurons
are produced in the ganglionic eminences, including an enormous
contribution from non-epithelial SVZ stem cells.},
