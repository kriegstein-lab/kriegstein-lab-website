 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of individuals with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) have revealed a strong multigenic basis with the
identification of hundreds of ASD susceptibility genes. ASD is
characterized by social deficits and a range of other phenotypes,
implicating complex genetics and involvement of a variety of
brain regions. However, how mutations and mis-expression of
select gene sets are associated with the behavioral components of
ASD remains unknown. We reasoned that for genes to be associated
with ASD core behaviors they must be: (1) expressed in brain
regions relevant to ASD social behaviors and (2) expressed during
the ASD susceptible window of brain development. METHODS:
Focusing on the amygdala, a brain region whose dysfunction has
been highly implicated in the social component of ASD, we mined
publicly available gene expression databases to identify
ASD-susceptibility genes expressed during human and mouse
amygdala development. We found that a large cohort of known ASD
susceptibility genes is expressed in the developing human and
mouse amygdala. We further performed analysis of single-nucleus
RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from microdissected amygdala tissue from
five ASD and five control human postmortem brains ranging in age
from 4 to 20 years to elucidate cell type specificity of
amygdala-expressed genes and their dysregulation in ASD. RESULTS:
Our analyses revealed that of the high-ranking ASD susceptibility
genes, 80 are expressed in both human and mouse amygdala during
fetal to early postnatal stages of development. Our human
snRNA-seq analyses revealed cohorts of genes with altered
expression in the ASD amygdala postnatally, especially within
excitatory neurons, with dysregulated expression of seven genes
predicted from our datamining pipeline. LIMITATIONS: We were
limited by the ages for which we were able to obtain human
tissue; therefore, the results from our datamining pipeline
approach will require validation, to the extent possible, in
human tissue from earlier developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our
pipeline narrows down the number of amygdala-expressed genes
possibly involved in the social pathophysiology of ASD. Our human
single-nucleus gene expression analyses revealed that ASD is
characterized by changes in gene expression in specific cell
types in the early postnatal amygdala.},
