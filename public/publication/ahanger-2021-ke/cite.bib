 abstract = {Nuclear compartments are thought to play a role in
three-dimensional genome organization and gene expression. In
mammalian brain, the architecture and dynamics of nuclear
compartment-associated genome organization is not known. In this
study, we developed Genome Organization using CUT and RUN
Technology (GO-CaRT) to map genomic interactions with two nuclear
compartments-the nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles-from
different regions of the developing mouse, macaque and human
brain. Lamina-associated domain (LAD) architecture in cells in
vivo is distinct from that of cultured cells, including major
differences in LADs previously considered to be cell type
invariant. In the mouse and human forebrain, dorsal and ventral
neural precursor cells have differences in LAD architecture that
correspond to their regional identity. LADs in the human and
mouse cortex contain transcriptionally highly active sub-domains
characterized by broad depletion of histone-3-lysine-9
dimethylation. Evolutionarily conserved LADs in human, macaque
and mouse brain are enriched for transcriptionally active neural
genes associated with synapse function. By integrating GO-CaRT
maps with genome-wide association study data, we found
speckle-associated domains to be enriched for schizophrenia risk
loci, indicating a physical relationship between these
disease-associated genetic variants and a specific nuclear
structure. Our work provides a framework for understanding the
relationship between distinct nuclear compartments and genome
function in brain development and disease.},
