 abstract = {The neocortex of primates, including humans, contains more
abundant and diverse inhibitory neurons compared with rodents,
but the molecular foundations of these observations are unknown.
Through integrative gene coexpression analysis, we determined a
consensus transcriptional profile of GABAergic neurons in
mid-gestation human neocortex. By comparing this profile to genes
expressed in GABAergic neurons purified from neonatal mouse
neocortex, we identified conserved and distinct aspects of gene
expression in these cells between the species. We show here that
the calcium-binding protein secretagogin (SCGN) is robustly
expressed by neocortical GABAergic neurons derived from caudal
ganglionic eminences (CGE) and lateral ganglionic eminences
during human but not mouse brain development. Through
electrophysiological and morphometric analyses, we examined the
effects of SCGN expression on GABAergic neuron function and form.
Forced expression of SCGN in CGE-derived mouse GABAergic neurons
significantly increased total neurite length and arbor complexity
following transplantation into mouse neocortex, revealing a
molecular pathway that contributes to morphological differences
in these cells between rodents and primates.},
