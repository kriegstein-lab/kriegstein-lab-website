 abstract = {PURPOSE: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is associated with epilepsy in
both the pediatric and adult populations. The mechanism
underlying seizures with cortical malformations is still poorly
understood. To study the physiology of dysplastic cortex, we
developed an experimental model of CD. METHODS: Pregnant rats
were given intraperitoneal injections of carmustine
(1-3-bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea; BCNU) on embryonic day 15
(E15). Cortical histology was examined in the resulting pups at
P0, P28, and P60. In addition, evoked and spontaneous field
potential recordings were obtained in cortical slices from adult
control and BCNU-exposed rats. Finally, we used whole-cell
recordings to compare physiologic properties of pyramidal neurons
and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in control and
BCNU-treated animals. RESULTS: Features characteristic of CD were
found in the offspring, including laminar disorganization,
cytomegalic neurons, and neuronal heterotopias. Dysplastic cortex
also contained abnormal clusters of Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells and
disruption of radial glial fibers, as demonstrated with
immunohistochemistry. Under conditions of partial GABAA-receptor
blockade with 10 microM bicuculline methiodide (BMI), slices of
dysplastic cortex demonstrated a significant increase in the
number of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform discharges.
Individual pyramidal neurons in dysplastic cortex were less
sensitive to application of GABA compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: BCNU exposure in utero produces histologic
alterations suggestive of CD in rat offspring. Dysplastic cortex
from this model demonstrates features of hyperexcitability and
decreased neuronal sensitivity to GABA. Such physiologic
alterations may underlie the increased epileptogenicity of
dysplastic cortex.},
