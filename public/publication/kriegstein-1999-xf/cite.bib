 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inhalation of heated heroin vapor (``chasing the
dragon''), which is gaining popularity among drug users seeking
to avoid the risks of parenteral drug administration, can produce
progressive spongiform leukoencephalopathy. METHODS: We studied
the clinical phenotype and course, MRI, MRS, and brain pathology
in the first American patients described with this syndrome.
RESULTS: Two of the three heroin users studied inhaled heroin
pyrolysate together daily over the course of 2 weeks. They
developed ataxia, dysmetria, and dysarthria. Patient 1 progressed
to an akinetic mute state with decorticate posture and subsequent
spastic quadriparesis. Patient 2 developed a mild spastic
quadriparesis and gait freezing. Patient 3 was asymptomatic
following less heroin exposure. Brain MRI showed diffuse,
symmetrical white matter hyperintensities in the cerebellum,
posterior cerebrum, posterior limbs of the internal capsule,
splenium of the corpus callosum, medial lemniscus, and lateral
brainstem. MRS showed elevated lactate. Brain biopsy (Patient 1)
showed white matter spongiform degeneration with relative sparing
of U-fibers; electron microscopy revealed intramyelinic
vacuolation with splitting of intraperiod lines. Progressive
deterioration occurred in Patients 1 and 2 over 4 weeks. Both
were treated with antioxidants including oral coenzyme Q, and
clinical improvement occurred. Patient 1 recovered nearly
completely over 24 months. Patient 2 improved, but developed a
delayed-onset cerebellar hand tremor. Both still have white
matter abnormalities on MRI and MRS. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated
lactate in white matter and the possible response to antioxidants
suggests mitochondrial dysfunction in progressive spongiform
leukoencephalopathy following inhalation of heated heroin vapor.},
