 abstract = {The majority of neurons in the adult neocortex are produced
embryonically during a brief but intense period of neuronal
proliferation. The radial glial cell, a transient embryonic cell
type known for its crucial role in neuronal migration, has
recently been shown to function as a neuronal progenitor cell and
appears to produce most cortical pyramidal neurons. Radial glial
cell modulation could thus affect neuron production, neuronal
migration, and overall cortical architecture; however, signaling
mechanisms among radial glia have not been studied directly. We
demonstrate here that calcium waves propagate through radial
glial cells in the proliferative cortical ventricular zone (VZ).
Radial glial calcium waves occur spontaneously and require
connexin hemichannels, P2Y1 ATP receptors, and intracellular
IP3-mediated calcium release. Furthermore, we show that wave
disruption decreases VZ proliferation during the peak of
embryonic neurogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate
a radial glial signaling mechanism that may regulate cortical
neuronal production.},
