 abstract = {In the developing human neocortex, progenitor cells generate
diverse cell types prenatally. Progenitor cells and newborn
neurons respond to signaling cues, including neurotransmitters.
While single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed cellular diversity,
physiological heterogeneity has yet to be mapped onto these
developing and diverse cell types. By combining measurements of
intracellular Ca(2+) elevations in response to neurotransmitter
receptor agonists and RNA sequencing of the same single cells, we
show that Ca(2+) responses are cell-type-specific and change
dynamically with lineage progression. Physiological response
properties predict molecular cell identity and additionally
reveal diversity not captured by single-cell transcriptomics. We
find that the serotonin receptor HTR2A selectively activates
radial glia cells in the developing human, but not mouse,
neocortex, and inhibiting HTR2A receptors in human radial glia
disrupts the radial glial scaffold. We show highly specific
neurotransmitter signaling during neurogenesis in the developing
human neocortex and highlight evolutionarily divergent mechanisms
of physiological signaling.},
