 abstract = {Recent work suggests that radial glial cells represent many, if
not most, of the neuronal progenitors in the developing cortex.
Asymmetric cell division of radial glia results in the
self-renewal of the radial glial cell and the birth of a neuron.
Among the proteins that direct cell fate in Drosophila
melanogaster that have known mammalian homologs, Numb is the best
candidate to have a similar function in radial glia. During
asymmetric divisions of radial glial cells, the basal cell may
inherit the radial glial fibre, while the apical cell sequesters
the majority of the Numb protein. We suggest two models that make
opposite predictions as to whether the radial glia or nascent
neuron inherit the radial glial fiber or the majority of the Numb
protein.},
