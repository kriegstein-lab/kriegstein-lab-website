 abstract = {Real-time imaging of migrating neurons has changed our
understanding of how newborn neurons reach their final positions
in the developing cerebral cortex. The migratory routes and modes
of migration are more diverse and complex than previously
thought. The finding that cortical interneurons migrate to the
cortex from origins in the ventral telencephalon has already
markedly altered our view of cortical migration. More recent
findings have demonstrated additional nuances in the migratory
pattern and highlighted differences between subsets of
interneurons. Moreover, radial migration of pyramidal neurons
does not progress smoothly from ventricle to cortical plate, but
is instead characterized by distinct migratory phases in which
neurons change shape and direction of movement. Integrating these
findings with the molecular machinery underlying migration will
provide a more complete picture of how the cerebral cortex is
assembled.},
