 abstract = {A hallmark of mammalian brain evolution is cortical expansion,
which reflects an increase in the number of cortical neurons
established by the progenitor cell subtypes present and the
number of their neurogenic divisions. Recent studies have
revealed a new class of radial glia-like (oRG) progenitor cells
in the human brain, which reside in the outer subventricular
zone. Expansion of the subventricular zone and appearance of oRG
cells may have been essential evolutionary steps leading from
lissencephalic to gyrencephalic neocortex. Here we show that
oRG-like progenitor cells are present in the mouse embryonic
neocortex. They arise from asymmetric divisions of radial glia
and undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions to generate
neurons. Moreover, mouse oRG cells undergo mitotic somal
translocation whereby centrosome movement into the basal process
during interphase precedes nuclear translocation. Our finding of
oRG cells in the developing rodent brain fills a gap in our
understanding of neocortical expansion.},
