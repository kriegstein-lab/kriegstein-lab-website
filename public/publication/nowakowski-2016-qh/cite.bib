 abstract = {The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil has been
linked to substantial increases in fetal abnormalities and
microcephaly. However, information about the underlying molecular
and cellular mechanisms connecting viral infection to these
defects remains limited. In this study we have examined the
expression of receptors implicated in cell entry of several
enveloped viruses including ZIKV across diverse cell types in the
developing brain. Using single-cell RNA-seq and
immunohistochemistry, we found that the candidate viral entry
receptor AXL is highly expressed by human radial glial cells,
astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia in developing human
cortex and by progenitor cells in developing retina. We also show
that AXL expression in radial glia is conserved in developing
mouse and ferret cortex and in human stem cell-derived cerebral
organoids, highlighting multiple experimental systems that could
be applied to study mechanisms of ZIKV infectivity and effects on
brain development.},
