 abstract = {Proliferative cells lining the cerebral ventricles generate all
of the phenotypically diverse neurons of the adult cortex. Recent
evidence indicates that cell cycle events of neuronal precursor
cells are under the influence of neurotransmitters and a variety
of signaling factors. The newly discovered environmental factors
that regulate neurogenesis promise to expand our understanding of
the mechanisms responsible for cerebral malformations and
disorders of cortical organization.},
