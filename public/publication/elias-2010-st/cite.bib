 abstract = {The adult cerebral cortex is composed of excitatory and
inhibitory neurons that arise from progenitor cells in disparate
proliferative regions in the developing brain and follow
different migratory paths. Excitatory pyramidal neurons originate
near the ventricle and migrate radially to their position in the
cortical plate along radial glial fibers. On the other hand,
inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and
migrate tangentially to enter the developing cortex before
migrating radially to reach their correct laminar position. Gap
junction adhesion has been shown to play an important mechanistic
role in the radial migration of excitatory neurons. We asked
whether a similar mechanism governs the tangential or radial
migration of inhibitory interneurons. Using short hairpin RNA
knockdown of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx26 together with rescue
experiments, we found that gap junctions are dispensable for the
tangential migration of interneurons, but that Cx43 plays a role
in the switch from tangential to radial migration that allows
interneurons to enter the cortical plate and find their correct
laminar position. Moreover this action is dependent on the
adhesive properties and the C terminus of Cx43 but not the Cx43
channel. Thus, the radial phase of interneuron migration
resembles that of excitatory neuron migration in terms of
dependence on Cx43 adhesion. Furthermore, gap junctions between
migrating interneurons and radial processes were observed by
electron microscopy. These findings provide mechanistic and
structural support for a gap junction-mediated interaction
between migrating interneurons and radial glia during the switch
from tangential to radial migration.},
