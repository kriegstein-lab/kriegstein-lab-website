 abstract = {While thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been
identified, few lncRNAs that control neural stem cell (NSC)
behavior are known. Here, we identify Pinky (Pnky) as a
neural-specific lncRNA that regulates neurogenesis from NSCs in
the embryonic and postnatal brain. In postnatal NSCs, Pnky
knockdown potentiates neuronal lineage commitment and expands the
transit-amplifying cell population, increasing neuron production
several-fold. Pnky is evolutionarily conserved and expressed in
NSCs of the developing human brain. In the embryonic mouse
cortex, Pnky knockdown increases neuronal differentiation and
depletes the NSC population. Pnky interacts with the splicing
regulator PTBP1, and PTBP1 knockdown also enhances neurogenesis.
In NSCs, Pnky and PTBP1 regulate the expression and alternative
splicing of a core set of transcripts that relates to the
cellular phenotype. These data thus unveil Pnky as a conserved
lncRNA that interacts with a key RNA processing factor and
regulates neurogenesis from embryonic and postnatal NSC
populations.},
