 abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
readily infects a variety of cell types impacting the function of
vital organ systems, with particularly severe impact on
respiratory function. It proves fatal for one percent of those
infected. Neurological symptoms, which range in severity,
accompany a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases, indicating
a potential vulnerability of neural cell types. To assess whether
human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we
utilized primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived
cortical organoids. We find significant and predominant infection
in cortical astrocytes in both primary and organoid cultures,
with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected
astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity
characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress.
Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal
ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus
receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147.
Inhibition of DPP4 reduced infection and decreased expression of
the cell stress marker, ARCN1. We find tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for
human astrocytes mediated by DPP4, resulting in reactive
gliosis-type injury.},
