 abstract = {Human cerebral cortex size and complexity has increased greatly
during evolution. While increased progenitor diversity and
enhanced proliferative potential play important roles in human
neurogenesis and gray matter expansion, the mechanisms of human
oligodendrogenesis and white matter expansion remain largely
unknown. Here, we identify EGFR-expressing ``Pre-OPCs'' that
originate from outer radial glial cells (oRGs) and undergo
mitotic somal translocation (MST) during division. oRG-derived
Pre-OPCs provide an additional source of human cortical
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and define a lineage
trajectory. We further show that human OPCs undergo consecutive
symmetric divisions to exponentially increase the progenitor pool
size. Additionally, we find that the OPC-enriched gene, PCDH15,
mediates daughter cell repulsion and facilitates proliferation.
These findings indicate properties of OPC derivation,
proliferation, and dispersion important for human white matter
expansion and myelination.},
