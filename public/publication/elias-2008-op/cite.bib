 abstract = {The development of glutamatergic synapses involves changes in the
number and type of receptors present at the postsynaptic density.
To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying these changes, we
combine in utero electroporation of constructs that alter the
molecular composition of developing synapses with dual whole-cell
electrophysiology to examine synaptic transmission during two
distinct developmental stages. We find that SAP102 mediates
synaptic trafficking of AMPA and NMDA receptors during
synaptogenesis. Surprisingly, after synaptogenesis, PSD-95
assumes the functions of SAP102 and is necessary for two aspects
of synapse maturation: the developmental increase in AMPA
receptor transmission and replacement of NR2B-NMDARs with
NR2A-NMDARs. In PSD-95/PSD-93 double-KO mice, the maturational
replacement of NR2B- with NR2A-NMDARs fails to occur, and PSD-95
expression fully rescues this deficit. This study demonstrates
that SAP102 and PSD-95 regulate the synaptic trafficking of
distinct glutamate receptor subtypes at different developmental
stages, thereby playing necessary roles in excitatory synapse
development.},
