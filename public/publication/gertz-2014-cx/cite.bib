 abstract = {The dramatic increase in neocortical size and folding during
mammalian brain evolution has been attributed to the elaboration
of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the associated increase in
neural progenitors. However, recent studies have shown that SVZ
size and the abundance of resident progenitors do not directly
predict cortical topography, suggesting that complex behaviors of
the progenitors themselves may contribute to the overall size and
shape of the adult cortex. Using time-lapse imaging, we examined
the dynamic behaviors of SVZ progenitors in the ferret, a
gyrencephalic carnivore, focusing our analysis on outer radial
glial cells (oRGs). We identified a substantial population of
oRGs by marker expression and their unique mode of division,
termed mitotic somal translocation (MST). Ferret oRGs exhibited
diverse behaviors in terms of division location, cleavage angle,
and MST distance, as well as fiber orientation and dynamics. We
then examined the human fetal cortex and found that a subset of
human oRGs displayed similar characteristics, suggesting that
diversity in oRG behavior may be a general feature. Similar to
the human, ferret oRGs underwent multiple rounds of self-renewing
divisions but were more likely to undergo symmetric divisions
that expanded the oRG population, as opposed to producing
intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). Differences in oRG
behaviors, including proliferative potential and daughter cell
fates, may contribute to variations in cortical structure between
mammalian species.},
