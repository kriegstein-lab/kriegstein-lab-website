 abstract = {Scientific progress in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research
and increased funding make it imperative to look ahead to the
ethical issues generated by the expected use of hESCs for
transplantation. Several issues should be addressed now, even
though phase I clinical trials of hESC transplantation are still
in the future. To minimize the risk of hESC transplantation,
donors of materials used to derive hESC lines will need to be
recontacted to update their medical history and screening.
Because of privacy concerns, such recontact needs to be discussed
and agreed to at the time of donation, before new hESC lines are
derived. Informed consent for phase I clinical trials of hESC
transplantation also raises ethical concerns. In previous phase I
trials of highly innovative interventions, allegations that trial
participants had not really understood the risk and benefits
caused delays in subsequent trials. Thus, researchers should
consider what information needs to be discussed during the
consent process for hESC clinical trials and how to verify that
participants have a realistic understanding of the study. Lack of
attention to the special ethical concerns raised by clinical
trials of hESC transplantation and their implications for the
derivation of new hESC lines may undermine or delay progress
toward stem cell therapies.},
