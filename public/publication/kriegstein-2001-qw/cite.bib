 abstract = {Early in development, synapses with glycine or gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels exhibit the ability to
depolarize postsynaptic cells. As the synapses mature and the
gradient of chloride ions across the cell membrane is altered,
these neurotransmitters signal an inhibitory response,
hyperpolarizing the membrane and decreasing neuronal
excitability. Kriegstein and Owens discuss how GABA-stimulated
up-regulation of the expression of the potassium chloride
cotransporter KCC2 may be the mechanism underlying this synaptic
switch.},
