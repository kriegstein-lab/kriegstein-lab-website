 abstract = {To utilize the advantages offered by the large identified nerve
cells of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica for cellular
biological studies of development, we have devised simple
techniques for growing this species in the laboratory in large
number with a generation time as short as nineteen weeks. We have
used the cultured animals to study the life cycle from fertilized
egg to reproductive adult. The major developmental and behavioral
changes occur at metamorphosis, when the larvae settle on the
seaweed Laurencia pacifica and the locomotor and feeding
behaviors are transformed into their adult forms. We have
examined the timetable for the abandonment of larval behaviors
and the emergence of adult ones and found that the transition
from swimming to crawling occurs first and marks the onset of
metamorphosis. The change from ciliary feeding to radular feeding
occurs later and signals the end of metamorphosis. Other adult
behaviors, such as the reflex responses and fixed-action patterns
of the mantle organs, appear after metamorphosis.},
