 abstract = {The human brain is subdivided into distinct anatomical
structures, including the neocortex, which in turn encompasses
dozens of distinct specialized cortical areas. Early
morphogenetic gradients are known to establish early brain
regions and cortical areas, but how early patterns result in
finer and more discrete spatial differences remains poorly
understood(1). Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile
ten major brain structures and six neocortical areas during peak
neurogenesis and early gliogenesis. Within the neocortex, we find
that early in the second trimester, a large number of genes are
differentially expressed across distinct cortical areas in all
cell types, including radial glia, the neural progenitors of the
cortex. However, the abundance of areal transcriptomic signatures
increases as radial glia differentiate into intermediate
progenitor cells and ultimately give rise to excitatory neurons.
Using an automated, multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in
situ hybridization approach, we find that laminar gene-expression
patterns are highly dynamic across cortical regions. Together,
our data suggest that early cortical areal patterning is defined
by strong, mutually exclusive frontal and occipital
gene-expression signatures, with resulting gradients giving rise
to the specification of areas between these two poles throughout
successive developmental timepoints.},
