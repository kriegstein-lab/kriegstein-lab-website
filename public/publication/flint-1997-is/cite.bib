 abstract = {Neuronal migration disorders are often associated with
intractable epilepsy. These cortical malformations are quite
heterogeneous, suggesting that they may result from interference
with a diverse set of processes during corticogenesis. Progress
toward understanding the pathophysiologic basis of these
disorders is coming from research into the basic mechanisms of
corticogenesis, animal models of cortical malformations, and
molecular genetic approaches to migration disorders.},
