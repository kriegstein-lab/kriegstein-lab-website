 abstract = {Large-scale surveys of single-cell gene expression have the
potential to reveal rare cell populations and lineage
relationships but require efficient methods for cell capture and
mRNA sequencing. Although cellular barcoding strategies allow
parallel sequencing of single cells at ultra-low depths, the
limitations of shallow sequencing have not been investigated
directly. By capturing 301 single cells from 11 populations using
microfluidics and analyzing single-cell transcriptomes across
downsampled sequencing depths, we demonstrate that shallow
single-cell mRNA sequencing (~50,000 reads per cell) is
sufficient for unbiased cell-type classification and biomarker
identification. In the developing cortex, we identify diverse
cell types, including multiple progenitor and neuronal subtypes,
and we identify EGR1 and FOS as previously unreported candidate
targets of Notch signaling in human but not mouse radial glia.
Our strategy establishes an efficient method for unbiased
analysis and comparison of cell populations from heterogeneous
tissue by microfluidic single-cell capture and low-coverage
sequencing of many cells.},
