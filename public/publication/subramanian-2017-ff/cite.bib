 abstract = {To understand how diverse progenitor cells contribute to human
neocortex development, we examined forebrain progenitor behaviour
using timelapse imaging. Here we find that cell cycle dynamics of
human neuroepithelial (NE) cells differ from radial glial (RG)
cells in both primary tissue and in stem cell-derived organoids.
NE cells undergoing proliferative, symmetric divisions retract
their basal processes, and both daughter cells regrow a new
process following cytokinesis. The mitotic retraction of the
basal process is recapitulated by NE cells in cerebral organoids
generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. In contrast,
RG cells undergoing vertical cleavage retain their basal fibres
throughout mitosis, both in primary tissue and in older
organoids. Our findings highlight developmentally regulated
changes in mitotic behaviour that may relate to the role of RG
cells to provide a stable scaffold for neuronal migration, and
suggest that the transition in mitotic dynamics can be studied in
organoid models.},
