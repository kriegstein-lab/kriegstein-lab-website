 abstract = {Precise patterns of cell division and migration are crucial to
transform the neuroepithelium of the embryonic forebrain into the
adult cerebral cortex. Using time-lapse imaging of clonal cells
in rat cortex over several generations, we show here that neurons
are generated in two proliferative zones by distinct patterns of
division. Neurons arise directly from radial glial cells in the
ventricular zone (VZ) and indirectly from intermediate progenitor
cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Furthermore, newborn
neurons do not migrate directly to the cortex; instead, most
exhibit four distinct phases of migration, including a phase of
retrograde movement toward the ventricle before migration to the
cortical plate. These findings provide a comprehensive and new
view of the dynamics of cortical neurogenesis and migration.},
