 abstract = {Glioblastoma is a devastating form of brain cancer. To identify
aspects of tumor heterogeneity that may illuminate drivers of
tumor invasion, we created a glioblastoma tumor cell atlas with
single-cell transcriptomics of cancer cells mapped onto a
reference framework of the developing and adult human brain. We
find that multiple GSC subtypes exist within a single tumor.
Within these GSCs, we identify an invasive cell population
similar to outer radial glia (oRG), a fetal cell type that
expands the stem cell niche in normal human cortex. Using live
time-lapse imaging of primary resected tumors, we discover that
tumor-derived oRG-like cells undergo characteristic mitotic somal
translocation behavior previously only observed in human
development, suggesting a reactivation of developmental programs.
In addition, we show that PTPRZ1 mediates both mitotic somal
translocation and glioblastoma tumor invasion. These data suggest
that the presence of heterogeneous GSCs may underlie
glioblastoma's rapid progression and invasion.},
