 abstract = {Recent work has begun to identify neural stem and progenitor
cells in the embryonic and adult brain, and is unravelling the
mechanisms whereby new nerve cells are created and delivered to
their correct locations. Radial glial (RG) cells, which are
present in the developing mammalian brain, have been proposed to
be neural stem cells because they produce multiple cell types.
Furthermore, time-lapse imaging demonstrates that RG cells
undergo asymmetric self-renewing divisions to produce immature
neurons that migrate along their parent radial fibre to reach the
developing cerebral cortex. RG cells also produce intermediate
progenitor (IP) cells that undergo symmetric division in the
subventricular zone of the embryonic cortex to produce pairs of
neurons. The symmetric IP divisions increase cell number within
the same cortical layer. This two-step process of neurogenesis
suggests new mechanisms for the generation of cell diversity and
cell number in the developing cortex and supports a model similar
to that proposed for the development of the fruit fly CNS. In
this model, a temporal sequence of gene expression changes in
asymmetrically dividing self-renewed RG cells could lead to the
differential inheritance of cell identity genes in cortical cells
generated at different cell cycles.},
