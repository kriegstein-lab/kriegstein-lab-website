 abstract = {Aberrant aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in neurons
is a hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degeneration caused by
haploinsufficiency in the gene encoding progranulin(1,2).
However, the mechanism leading to TDP-43 proteinopathy remains
unclear. Here we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that
progranulin deficiency promotes microglial transition from a
homeostatic to a disease-specific state that causes endolysosomal
dysfunction and neurodegeneration in mice. These defects persist
even when Grn(-/-) microglia are cultured ex vivo. In addition,
single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals selective loss of
excitatory neurons at disease end-stage, which is characterized
by prominent nuclear and cytoplasmic TDP-43 granules and nuclear
pore defects. Remarkably, conditioned media from Grn(-/-)
microglia are sufficient to promote TDP-43 granule formation,
nuclear pore defects and cell death in excitatory neurons via the
complement activation pathway. Consistent with these results,
deletion of the genes encoding C1qa and C3 mitigates microglial
toxicity and rescues TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration.
These results uncover previously unappreciated contributions of
chronic microglial toxicity to TDP-43 proteinopathy during
neurodegeneration.},
