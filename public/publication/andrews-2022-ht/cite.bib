 abstract = {Organoids are 3D cell culture systems derived from human
pluripotent stem cells that contain tissue resident cell types
and reflect features of early tissue organization. Neural
organoids are a particularly innovative scientific advance given
the lack of accessibility of developing human brain tissue and
intractability of neurological diseases. Neural organoids have
become an invaluable approach to model features of human brain
development that are not well reflected in animal models.
Organoids also hold promise for the study of atypical cellular,
molecular, and genetic features that underscore neurological
diseases. Additionally, organoids may provide a platform for
testing therapeutics in human cells and are a potential source
for cell replacement approaches to brain injury or disease.
Despite the promising features of organoids, their broad utility
is tempered by a variety of limitations yet to be overcome,
including lack of high-fidelity cell types, limited maturation,
atypical physiology, and lack of arealization, features that may
limit their reliability for certain applications.},
