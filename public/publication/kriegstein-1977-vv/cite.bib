 abstract = {The ability to grow the marine molluse Aplysia under laboratory
conditions allows a detailed study of the formation of the
nervous system and of the development of specific identified
cells. I have found that the ganglia develop in a specific
temporal order. Cerebral and pedal ganglia develop at hatching,
the abdominal, pleural, and osphradial ganglia 3 weeks after
hatching, and the buccal ganglia at 4 weeks. The origin of the
abdominal ganglion is complex; its anlage forms at 3 weeks from
three larval ganglia that fuse to form the abdominal ganglion.
Individual cells cannot be distinguished from one another by
their location within the ganglion or by their appearance alone
until metamorphosis at 5 weeks. After metamorphosis, the
identified neuron, R2, suddenly becomes recognizable because of a
significant increase in its size.},
