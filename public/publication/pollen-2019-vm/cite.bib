 abstract = {Direct comparisons of human and non-human primate brains can
reveal molecular pathways underlying remarkable specializations
of the human brain. However, chimpanzee tissue is inaccessible
during neocortical neurogenesis when differences in brain size
first appear. To identify human-specific features of cortical
development, we leveraged recent innovations that permit
generating pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids from
chimpanzee. Despite metabolic differences, organoid models
preserve gene regulatory networks related to primary cell types
and developmental processes. We further identified 261
differentially expressed genes in human compared to both
chimpanzee organoids and macaque cortex, enriched for recent gene
duplications, and including multiple regulators of PI3K-AKT-mTOR
signaling. We observed increased activation of this pathway in
human radial glia, dependent on two receptors upregulated
specifically in human: INSR and ITGB8. Our findings establish a
platform for systematic analysis of molecular changes
contributing to human brain development and evolution.},
