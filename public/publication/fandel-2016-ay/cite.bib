 abstract = {Neuropathic pain and bladder dysfunction represent significant
quality-of-life issues for many spinal cord injury patients. Loss
of GABAergic tone in the injured spinal cord may contribute to
the emergence of these symptoms. Previous studies have shown that
transplantation of rodent inhibitory interneuron precursors from
the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) enhances GABAergic signaling
in the brain and spinal cord. Here we look at whether
transplanted MGE-like cells derived from human embryonic stem
cells (hESC-MGEs) can mitigate the pathological effects of spinal
cord injury. We find that 6 months after transplantation into
injured mouse spinal cords, hESC-MGEs differentiate into
GABAergic neuron subtypes and receive synaptic inputs, suggesting
functional integration into host spinal cord. Moreover, the
transplanted animals show improved bladder function and
mitigation of pain-related symptoms. Our results therefore
suggest that this approach may be a valuable strategy for
ameliorating the adverse effects of spinal cord injury.},
