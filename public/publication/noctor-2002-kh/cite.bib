 abstract = {The embryonic ventricular zone (VZ) of the cerebral cortex
contains migrating neurons, radial glial cells, and a large
population of cycling progenitor cells that generate newborn
neurons. The latter two cell classes have been assumed for some
time to be distinct in both function and anatomy, but the
cellular anatomy of the progenitor cell type has remained poorly
defined. Several recent reports have raised doubts about the
distinction between radial glial and precursor cells by
demonstrating that radial glial cells are themselves neuronal
progenitor cells (Malatesta et al., 2000; Hartfuss et al., 2001;
Miyata et al., 2001; Noctor et al., 2001). This discovery raises
the possibility that radial glia and the population of VZ
progenitor cells may be one anatomical and functional cell class.
Such a hypothesis predicts that throughout neurogenesis almost
all mitotically active VZ cells and a substantial percentage of
VZ cells overall are radial glia. We have therefore used various
anatomical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological
techniques to test these predictions. Our data demonstrate that
the majority of VZ cells, and nearly all mitotically active VZ
cells during neurogenesis, both have radial glial morphology and
express radial glial markers. In addition, intracellular dye
filling of electrophysiologically characterized progenitor cells
in the VZ demonstrates that these cells have the morphology of
radial glia. Because the vast majority cycling cells in the
cortical VZ have characteristics of radial glia, the radial glial
precursor cell may be responsible for both the production of
newborn neurons and the guidance of daughter neurons to their
destinations in the developing cortex.},
