 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in
gliomas and immunosuppressive TAMs are a barrier to emerging
immunotherapies. It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived
from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident
microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of
blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly
quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that
distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. RESULTS: We
perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify
phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate
TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from
non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma
models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by
ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate
immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism
compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in
perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of
blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with
significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma.
Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical
pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in
individual cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that blood-derived
TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree
that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment.
Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of
microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines
and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status
quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and
in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive
blood-derived TAMs.},
