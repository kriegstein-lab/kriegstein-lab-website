 abstract = {We have found that, during the early stages of cortical
neurogenesis, both GABA and glutamate depolarize cells in the
ventricular zone of rat embryonic neocortex. In the ventricular
zone, glutamate acts on AMPA/kainate receptors, while GABA acts
on GABAA receptors. GABA induces an inward current at resting
membrane potentials, presumably owing to a high intracellular Cl-
concentration maintained by furosemide-sensitive Cl- transport.
GABA and glutamate also produce increases in intracellular Ca2+
in ventricular zone cells, in part through activation of
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, GABA and glutamate
decrease the number of embryonic cortical cells synthesizing DNA.
Depolarization with K+ similarly decreases DNA synthesis,
suggesting that the neurotransmitters act via membrane
depolarization. Applied alone, GABAA and AMPA/kainate receptor
antagonists increase DNA synthesis, indicating that endogenously
released amino acids influence neocortical progenitors in the
cell cycle. These results demonstrate a novel role for amino acid
neurotransmitters in regulating neocortical neurogenesis.},
