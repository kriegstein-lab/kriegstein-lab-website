 abstract = {Neuroserpin is a serine-protease inhibitor mainly expressed in
the CNS and involved in the inhibition of the proteolytic
cascade. Animal models confirmed its neuroprotective role in
perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia and adult stroke. Although
neuroserpin may be a potential therapeutic target in the
treatment of the aforementioned conditions, there is still no
information in the literature on its distribution during human
brain development. The present study provides a detailed
description of the changing spatiotemporal patterns of
neuroserpin focusing on physiological human brain development.
Five stages were distinguished within our examined age range
which spanned from the 7th gestational week until adulthood. In
particular, subplate and deep cortical plate neurons were
identified as the main sources of neuroserpin production between
the 25th gestational week and the first postnatal month. Our
immunohistochemical findings were substantiated by single cell
RNA sequencing data showing specific neuronal and glial cell
types expressing neuroserpin. The characterization of neuroserpin
expression during physiological human brain development is
essential for forthcoming studies which will explore its
involvement in pathological conditions, such as perinatal
hypoxia-ischaemia and adult stroke in human.},
