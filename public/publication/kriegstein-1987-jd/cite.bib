 abstract = {The cellular and synaptic physiology of developing rat
neocortical neurons was studied using the in vitro slice method.
Rats aged 1-28 days were used for analysis. During the first two
postnatal weeks several sequential changes occur in membrane
properties and evoked synaptic potentials. Immature neurons had
higher input resistances, more linear I-V characteristics, longer
membrane time constants, and slower rising and falling phases of
action potentials. The developmental increase in rate of rise of
the action potential suggests an increasing density of
voltage-dependent Na+-channels are inserted in neuronal membranes
during postnatal development. The higher input resistance of
young cells might be due to their small size and differences in
membrane properties. The long time constant indicates a higher
specific membrane resistivity of immature neurons. Postsynaptic
potentials (PSPs) recorded in young neurons were longer in
latency, longer in duration, and more fragile during repetitive
activation than their mature counterparts. In addition, PSPs
evoked in neurons of animals less than 1 week old did not contain
inhibitory postsynaptic components. These physiological features
of immature neocortical neurons help explain the pattern of
epileptogenesis in young animals. When neonatal cortical slices
were exposed to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists
penicillin or bicuculline, the frequency of occurrence of
discharges resembling epileptiform depolarization shifts
approached that found in mature slices only during the second
postnatal week. Depolarization shifts at younger ages were less
stereotyped and more sensitive to stimulus parameters than those
in mature neurons.},
