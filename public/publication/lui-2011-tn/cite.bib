 abstract = {The size and surface area of the mammalian brain are thought to
be critical determinants of intellectual ability. Recent studies
show that development of the gyrated human neocortex involves a
lineage of neural stem and transit-amplifying cells that forms
the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), a proliferative region
outside the ventricular epithelium. We discuss how proliferation
of cells within the OSVZ expands the neocortex by increasing
neuron number and modifying the trajectory of migrating neurons.
Relating these features to other mammalian species and known
molecular regulators of the mouse neocortex suggests how this
developmental process could have emerged in evolution.},
