 abstract = {We have made patch-clamp recordings from slices of fetal and
postnatal rat neocortex in order to study the initial expression
and activation of NMDA channels. Recordings from both whole cells
and outside-out patches indicated that functional NMDA channels
are expressed on neurons within the cortical plate, but not on
younger cells within the ventricular zone. The NMDA channels on
cortical plate neurons had a unitary conductance of approximately
40 pS, had a mean open time of approximately 6 msec, required
glycine to open, and were blocked in a voltage-dependent manner
by magnesium. These precocious channels were present before the
appearance of functional synaptic activity, yet like NMDA
channels in the mature neocortex, they were spontaneously
activated by an agonist within brain slices. These results
demonstrate that NMDA channels are initially expressed on
neocortical neurons some time between the last mitotic division
within the ventricular zone and completion of migration into the
cortical plate. These early NMDA channels have properties
characteristic of NMDA channels on more mature neurons and are
similarly activated by an endogenous agonist in situ. Their early
appearance and activation indicate that NMDA channels may play a
role during early stages of cortical development.},
