 abstract = {Interactions between angiogenesis and neurogenesis regulate
embryonic brain development. However, a comprehensive
understanding of the stages of vascular cell maturation is
lacking, especially in the prenatal human brain. Using
fluorescence-activated cell sorting, single-cell transcriptomics,
and histological and ultrastructural analyses, we show that an
ensemble of endothelial and mural cell subtypes tile the brain
vasculature during the second trimester. These vascular cells
follow distinct developmental trajectories and utilize diverse
signaling mechanisms, including collagen, laminin, and midkine,
to facilitate cell-cell communication and maturation.
Interestingly, our results reveal that tip cells, a subtype of
endothelial cells, are highly enriched near the ventricular zone,
the site of active neurogenesis. Consistent with these
observations, prenatal vascular cells transplanted into cortical
organoids exhibit restricted lineage potential that favors tip
cells, promotes neurogenesis, and reduces cellular stress.
Together, our results uncover important mechanisms into vascular
maturation during this critical period of human brain
development.},
