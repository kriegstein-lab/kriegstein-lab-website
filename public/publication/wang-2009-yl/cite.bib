 abstract = {Of the many signals in the developing nervous system, GABA
(gamma-aminobutyric acid) has been shown to be one of the
earliest neurotransmitters present. Unlike in the adult, where
this transmitter acts synaptically to inhibit neurons, during
development, GABA can depolarize progenitor cells and their
progeny due to their high intracellular chloride concentration.
This early form of GABA signalling may provide the main
excitatory drive for the immature cortical network and play a
central role in regulating cortical development. Many features of
GABA signalling are conserved in different species and are
recapitulated during neurogenesis in the adult brain,
demonstrating the importance of this versatile molecule in
driving cortical formation. Here, we present recent evidence
supporting the multiple functions of GABA during embryonic
development and adult neurogenesis, from regulating progenitor
proliferation to influencing the migration and maturation of
newborn neurons.},
