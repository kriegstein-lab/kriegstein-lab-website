 abstract = {The appearance of bicuculline-induced epileptiform discharges was
studied in embryonic turtle cortex using extracellular recording
techniques. Drug-induced discharges occurred at an early stage of
cortical plate formation, suggesting that mechanisms for
synchronizing neuronal discharges are functional at this stage.
Discharges originated in the medial cortex and increased in
amplitude and decreased in frequency with development.
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons and functional
GABA receptors are present in advance of excitatory synchronizing
mechanisms and may have a non-synaptic role in corticogenesis.},
