 abstract = {The development of a balance between excitatory and inhibitory
synapses is a critical process in the generation and maturation
of functional circuits. Accumulating evidence suggests that
neuronal activity plays an important role in achieving such a
balance in the developing cortex, but the mechanism that
regulates this process is unknown. During development, GABA, the
primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in adults, excites neurons as
a result of high expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)
cotransporter (NKCC1). Using NKCC1 RNA interference knockdown in
vivo, we show that GABA-induced depolarization is necessary for
proper excitatory synapse formation and dendritic development of
newborn cortical neurons. Blocking NKCC1 with the diuretic
bumetanide during development leads to similar persistent changes
in cortical circuitry in the adult. Interestingly, expression of
a voltage-independent NMDA receptor rescues the failure of NKCC1
knockdown neurons to develop excitatory AMPA transmission,
indicating that GABA depolarization cooperates with NMDA receptor
activation to regulate excitatory synapse formation. Our study
identifies an essential role for GABA in the synaptic integration
of newborn cortical neurons and suggests an activity-dependent
mechanism for achieving the balance between excitation and
inhibition in the developing cortex.},
