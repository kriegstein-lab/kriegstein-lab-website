 abstract = {Glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)) receptors
are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that
mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the adult central
nervous system. During development, the activation of these
receptors leads to membrane depolarization. Ligands for the two
receptors have important implications both in disease therapy and
as pharmacological tools. Terpene trilactones (ginkgolides and
bilobalide) are unique constituents of Ginkgo biloba extracts
that have various effects on the central nervous system. We have
investigated the relative potency of these compounds on glycine
and GABA(A) receptors. We find that most of the ginkgolides are
selective and potent antagonists of the glycine receptor.
Bilobalide, the single major component in G. biloba extracts,
also reduces glycine-induced currents, although to a lesser
extent. Both ginkgolides and bilobalide inhibit GABA(A)
receptors, with bilobalide demonstrating a more potent effect.
Additionally, we provide evidence that open channels are required
for glycine receptor inhibition by ginkgolides. Finally, we
employ molecular modeling to elucidate the similarities and
differences in the structure of the terpene trilactones to
account for the pharmacological properties of these compounds and
demonstrate a striking similarity between ginkgolides and
picrotoxinin, a GABA(A) and recombinant glycine alpha-homomeric
receptor antagonist.},
