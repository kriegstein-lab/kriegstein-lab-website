 abstract = {Many neurologic and psychiatric disorders are marked by
imbalances between neural excitation and inhibition. In the
cerebral cortex, inhibition is mediated largely by GABAergic
($Î³$-aminobutyric acid-secreting) interneurons, a cell type
that originates in the embryonic ventral telencephalon and
populates the cortex through long-distance tangential migration.
Remarkably, when transplanted from embryos or in vitro culture
preparations, immature interneurons disperse and integrate into
host brain circuits, both in the cerebral cortex and in other
regions of the central nervous system. These features make
interneuron transplantation a powerful tool for the study of
neurodevelopmental processes such as cell specification, cell
death, and cortical plasticity. Moreover, interneuron
transplantation provides a novel strategy for modifying neural
circuits in rodent models of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, mood
disorders, and chronic pain.},
