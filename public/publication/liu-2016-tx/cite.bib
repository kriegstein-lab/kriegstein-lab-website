 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse
class of transcripts that can regulate molecular and cellular
processes in brain development and disease. LncRNAs exhibit cell
type- and tissue-specific expression, but little is known about
the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human
brain. Furthermore, it has been unclear whether lncRNAs are
highly expressed in subsets of cells within tissues, despite
appearing lowly expressed in bulk populations. RESULTS: We use
strand-specific RNA-seq to deeply profile lncRNAs from
polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at
different stages of development, and we apply this reference to
analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs are
generally detected at low levels in bulk tissues, single-cell
transcriptomics of hundreds of neocortex cells reveal that many
lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell
type-specific. Notably, LOC646329 is a lncRNA enriched in single
radial glia cells but is detected at low abundance in tissues.
CRISPRi knockdown of LOC646329 indicates that this lncRNA
regulates cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: The discrete and
abundant expression of lncRNAs among individual cells has
important implications for both their biological function and
utility for distinguishing neural cell types.},
