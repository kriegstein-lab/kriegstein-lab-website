 abstract = {Neocortical precursor cells undergo symmetric and asymmetric
divisions while producing large numbers of diverse cortical cell
types. In Drosophila, cleavage plane orientation dictates the
inheritance of fate-determinants and the symmetry of newborn
daughter cells during neuroblast cell divisions. One model for
predicting daughter cell fate in the mammalian neocortex is also
based on cleavage plane orientation. Precursor cell divisions
with a cleavage plane orientation that is perpendicular with
respect to the ventricular surface (vertical) are predicted to be
symmetric, while divisions with a cleavage plane orientation that
is parallel to the surface (horizontal) are predicted to be
asymmetric neurogenic divisions. However, analysis of cleavage
plane orientation at the ventricle suggests that the number of
predicted neurogenic divisions might be insufficient to produce
large amounts of cortical neurons. To understand factors that
correlate with the symmetry of cell divisions, we examined rat
neocortical precursor cells in situ through real-time imaging,
marker analysis, and electrophysiological recordings. We find
that cleavage plane orientation is more closely associated with
precursor cell type than with daughter cell fate, as commonly
thought. Radial glia cells in the VZ primarily divide with a
vertical orientation throughout cortical development and undergo
symmetric or asymmetric self-renewing divisions depending on the
stage of development. In contrast, most intermediate progenitor
cells divide in the subventricular zone with a horizontal
orientation and produce symmetric daughter cells. We propose a
model for predicting daughter cell fate that considers precursor
cell type, stage of development, and the planar segregation of
fate determinants.},
