 abstract = {Focal, freeze-induced lesions were made in isolated hemispheres
of turtle cerebral cortex in vitro, permitting the investigation
of epileptiform discharges in a preparation with preserved
intracortical circuitry. Freeze lesions resulted in interictal
discharges and occasional ictal-like events. The interictal
discharges were dependent upon activation of non-NMDA excitatory
amino acid receptors and were affected by but did not require
NMDA receptor activation. Voltage clamp and current clamp
recordings revealed abnormal bursts of low-amplitude action
potentials in 36% of recorded neurons, while large, repetitive
inhibitory potentials, mediated by GABAA receptors, were recorded
in 90% of the neurons. Thus, prominent findings in this model
include abnormalities of both excitatory and inhibitory activity.
Since these changes in neuronal excitability resulted from a
localized physical injury, they may resemble the changes that
occur in acute posttraumatic epilepsy.},
