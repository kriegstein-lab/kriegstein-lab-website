 abstract = {Lineage-specific epigenomic changes during human corticogenesis
have been difficult to study owing to challenges with sample
availability and tissue heterogeneity. For example, previous
studies using single-cell RNA sequencing identified at least 9
major cell types and up to 26 distinct subtypes in the dorsal
cortex alone(1,2). Here we characterize cell-type-specific
cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and
transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells,
excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from
mid-gestational samples of the human cortex. We show that
chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene
regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated
variants enriched at distal interacting regions in a
cell-type-specific manner. In addition, promoters with increased
levels of chromatin interactivity-termed super-interactive
promoters-are enriched for lineage-specific genes, suggesting
that interactions at these loci contribute to the fine-tuning of
transcription. Finally, we develop CRISPRview, a technique that
integrates immunostaining, CRISPR interference, RNAscope, and
image analysis to validate cell-type-specific cis-regulatory
elements in heterogeneous populations of primary cells. Our
findings provide insights into cell-type-specific gene expression
patterns in the developing human cortex and advance our
understanding of gene regulation and lineage specification during
this crucial developmental window.},
