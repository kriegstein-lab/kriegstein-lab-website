 abstract = {Two distinct populations of cerebral cortical progenitor cells
that generate neurons during embryogenesis have been identified:
radial glial cells and intermediate progenitor cells. Despite
advances in our understanding of progenitor cell populations, we
know relatively little about factors that regulate their
proliferative behaviour. 17-beta-Estradiol (E2) is present in the
adult and developing mammalian brain, and plays an important role
in central nervous system processes such as neuronal
differentiation, survival and plasticity. E2 also stimulates
neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. We examined the role of
E2 during embryonic cortical neurogenesis through
immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, functional enzyme
assay, organotypic culture and in utero administration of
estradiol-blocking agents in mice. We show that aromatase, the E2
synthesizing enzyme, is present in the embryonic neocortex, that
estrogen receptor-alpha is present in progenitor cells during
cortical neurogenesis, that in vitro E2 administration rapidly
promotes proliferation, and that in utero blockade of estrogen
receptors decreases proliferation of embryonic cortical
progenitor cells. Furthermore, the E2 inhibitor alpha-fetoprotein
is expressed at high levels by radial glial cells but at lower
levels by intermediate progenitor cells, suggesting that E2
differentially influences the proliferation of these cortical
progenitor cell types. These findings demonstrate a new
functional role for E2 as a proliferative agent during critical
stages of cerebral cortex development.},
