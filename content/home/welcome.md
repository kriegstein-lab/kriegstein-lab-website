The **Kriegstein Lab** is located on the Parnassus Campus of the University of California at San Francisco.

<p style = "width:150%">
The Kriegstein lab focuses on the way in which neural stem and progenitor cells in the embryonic brain produce neurons, the diversity of neural cell types present in the developing brain, and ways in which this information can be used for cell based therapies to treat diseases of the nervous system. Recently, the lab has concentrated on human brain development and described a novel progenitor cell type, the outer radial glial cell, that contributes to expansion of the cerebral cortex and the diversity of upper cortical layer neurons. We are using single cell transcriptomics and multi-omics as well as spatial transcriptomics to understand how neuronal diversity is produced during human brain development. Organoid models are also employed for functional studies as well as insights into disease mechanisms.
