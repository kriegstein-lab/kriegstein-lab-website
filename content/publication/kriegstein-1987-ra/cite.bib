 abstract = {The resistance of the turtle brain to hypoxic injury permits a
unique in vitro preparation in which the organization and
function of visual cortex can be explored. Intracellular
recordings from cortical pyramidal neurons revealed biphasic
responses to flashes of light, consisting of an early phase
(50-100 msec) of concurrent inhibitory and excitatory activation,
followed by a longer, inhibitory phase (250-600 msec) composed of
summated Cl- -dependent postsynaptic potentials mediated by GABA.
This response sequence results from the coactivation of pyramidal
and GABAergic non-pyramidal cells, followed by feed-forward and
possibly feed-back pyramidal cell inhibition, and is partly
dependent on differences in the membrane properties of pyramidal
and non-pyramidal neurons.},
