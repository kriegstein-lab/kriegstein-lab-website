 abstract = {The precise connectivity of inputs and outputs is critical for
cerebral cortex function; however, the cellular mechanisms that
establish these connections are poorly understood. Here, we show
that the secreted molecule Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is involved in
synapse formation of a specific cortical circuit. Shh is
expressed in layer V corticofugal projection neurons and the Shh
receptor, Brother of CDO (Boc), is expressed in local and
callosal projection neurons of layer II/III that synapse onto the
subcortical projection neurons. Layer V neurons of mice lacking
functional Shh exhibit decreased synapses. Conversely, the loss
of functional Boc leads to a reduction in the strength of
synaptic connections onto layer Vb, but not layer II/III,
pyramidal neurons. These results demonstrate that Shh is
expressed in postsynaptic target cells while Boc is expressed in
a complementary population of presynaptic input neurons, and they
function to guide the formation of cortical microcircuitry.},
