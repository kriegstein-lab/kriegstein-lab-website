 abstract = {The human cortex contains inhibitory interneurons derived from
the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), a germinal zone in the
embryonic ventral forebrain. How this germinal zone generates
sufficient interneurons for the human brain remains unclear. We
found that the human MGE (hMGE) contains nests of proliferative
neuroblasts with ultrastructural and transcriptomic features that
distinguish them from other progenitors in the hMGE. When
dissociated hMGE cells are transplanted into the neonatal mouse
brain, they reform into nests containing proliferating
neuroblasts that generate young neurons that migrate extensively
into the mouse forebrain and mature into different subtypes of
functional interneurons. Together, these results indicate that
the nest organization and sustained proliferation of neuroblasts
in the hMGE provide a mechanism for the extended production of
interneurons for the human forebrain.},
