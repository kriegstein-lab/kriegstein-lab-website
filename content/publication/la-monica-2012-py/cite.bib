 abstract = {Recent discoveries concerning the architecture and cellular
dynamics of the developing human brain are revealing new
differences between mouse and human cortical development. In
mice, neurons are produced by ventricular radial glial (RG) cells
and subventricular zone intermediate progenitor (IP) cells. In
the human cortex, both ventricular RG and highly motile outer RG
cells generate IP cells, which undergo multiple rounds of transit
amplification in the outer subventricular zone before producing
neurons. This creates a more complex environment for neurogenesis
and neuronal migration, adding new arenas in which
neurodevelopmental disease gene mutation could disrupt
corticogenesis. A more complete understanding of disease
mechanisms will involve use of emerging model systems with
developmental programs more similar to that of the human
neocortex.},
