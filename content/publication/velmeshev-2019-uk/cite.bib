 abstract = {Despite the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of autism, bulk
gene expression studies show that changes in the neocortex of
autism patients converge on common genes and pathways. However,
direct assessment of specific cell types in the brain affected by
autism has not been feasible until recently. We used
single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cortical tissue from patients
with autism to identify autism-associated transcriptomic changes
in specific cell types. We found that synaptic signaling of
upper-layer excitatory neurons and the molecular state of
microglia are preferentially affected in autism. Moreover, our
results show that dysregulation of specific groups of genes in
cortico-cortical projection neurons correlates with clinical
severity of autism. These findings suggest that molecular changes
in upper-layer cortical circuits are linked to behavioral
manifestations of autism.},
