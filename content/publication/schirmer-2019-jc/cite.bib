 abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease with a
relapsing-remitting disease course at early stages, distinct
lesion characteristics in cortical grey versus subcortical white
matter and neurodegeneration at chronic stages. Here we used
single-nucleus RNA sequencing to assess changes in expression in
multiple cell lineages in MS lesions and validated the results
using multiplex in situ hybridization. We found selective
vulnerability and loss of excitatory CUX2-expressing projection
neurons in upper-cortical layers underlying meningeal
inflammation; such MS neuron populations exhibited upregulation
of stress pathway genes and long non-coding RNAs. Signatures of
stressed oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes and activated
microglia mapped most strongly to the rim of MS plaques. Notably,
single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified phagocytosing microglia
and/or macrophages by their ingestion and perinuclear import of
myelin transcripts, confirmed by functional mouse and human
culture assays. Our findings indicate lineage- and
region-specific transcriptomic changes associated with selective
cortical neuron damage and glial activation contributing to
progression of MS lesions.},
