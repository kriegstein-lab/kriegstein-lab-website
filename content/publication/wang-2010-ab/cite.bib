 abstract = {A high incidence of seizures occurs during the neonatal period
when immature networks are hyperexcitable and susceptible to
hypersyncrhonous activity. During development,
$γ$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory
neurotransmitter in adults, typically excites neurons due to high
expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1). NKCC1
facilitates seizures because it renders GABA activity excitatory
through intracellular Cl(-) accumulation, while blocking NKCC1
with bumetanide suppresses seizures. Bumetanide is currently
being tested in clinical trials for treatment of neonatal
seizures. By blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide during cortical
development, we found a critical period for the development of
$α$-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate
synapses. Disruption of GABA signaling during this window
resulted in permanent decreases in excitatory synaptic
transmission and sensorimotor gating deficits, a common feature
in schizophrenia. Our study identifies an essential role for
GABA-mediated depolarization in regulating the balance between
cortical excitation and inhibition during a critical period and
suggests a cautionary approach for using bumetanide in treating
neonatal seizures.},
