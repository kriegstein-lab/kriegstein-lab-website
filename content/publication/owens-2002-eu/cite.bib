 abstract = {Previous studies support an early role for neurotransmitter
signaling before synaptogenesis, but puzzlingly, a neurological
phenotype is absent in embryonic mice that lack vesicular
release. Demarque et al. (in this issue of Neuron) now report
that early release of transmitter is unconventional in not
requiring action potentials, Ca(2+) entry, or vesicle fusion,
thus potentially reconciling the discrepancy.},
