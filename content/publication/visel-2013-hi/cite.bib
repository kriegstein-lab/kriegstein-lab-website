 abstract = {The mammalian telencephalon plays critical roles in cognition,
motor function, and emotion. Though many of the genes required
for its development have been identified, the distant-acting
regulatory sequences orchestrating their in vivo expression are
mostly unknown. Here, we describe a digital atlas of in vivo
enhancers active in subregions of the developing telencephalon.
We identified more than 4,600 candidate embryonic forebrain
enhancers and studied the in vivo activity of 329 of these
sequences in transgenic mouse embryos. We generated serial sets
of histological brain sections for 145 reproducible forebrain
enhancers, resulting in a publicly accessible web-based data
collection comprising more than 32,000 sections. We also used
epigenomic analysis of human and mouse cortex tissue to directly
compare the genome-wide enhancer architecture in these species.
These data provide a primary resource for investigating gene
regulatory mechanisms of telencephalon development and enable
studies of the role of distant-acting enhancers in
neurodevelopmental disorders.},
