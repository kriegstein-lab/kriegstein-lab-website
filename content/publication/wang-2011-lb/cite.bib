 abstract = {Cleavage plane orientation has been thought to govern the fate of
neural stem cell progeny, but supporting evidence in the
neocortex has been sparse. A new study by Postiglione et al. in
this issue of Neuron shows that mouse Inscuteable-mediated
control of cleavage plane orientation regulates the output of
neural progenitor cells.},
