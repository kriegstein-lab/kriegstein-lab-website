 abstract = {The mammalian neocortex is composed of two major neuronal cell
types with distinct origins: excitatory pyramidal neurons and
inhibitory interneurons, generated in dorsal and ventral
progenitor zones of the embryonic telencephalon, respectively.
Thus, inhibitory neurons migrate relatively long distances to
reach their destination in the developing forebrain. The role of
lineage in the organization and circuitry of interneurons is
still not well understood. Utilizing a combination of genetics,
retroviral fate mapping, and lineage-specific retroviral barcode
labeling, we find that clonally related interneurons can be
widely dispersed while unrelated interneurons can be closely
clustered. These data suggest that migratory mechanisms related
to the clustering of interneurons occur largely independent of
their clonal origin.},
