 abstract = {Systematic analyses of spatiotemporal gene expression
trajectories during organogenesis have been challenging because
diverse cell types at different stages of maturation and
differentiation coexist in the emerging tissues. We identified
discrete cell types as well as temporally and spatially
restricted trajectories of radial glia maturation and
neurogenesis in developing human telencephalon. These
lineage-specific trajectories reveal the expression of neurogenic
transcription factors in early radial glia and enriched
activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in outer
radial glia. Across cortical areas, modest transcriptional
differences among radial glia cascade into robust typological
distinctions among maturing neurons. Together, our results
support a mixed model of topographical, typological, and temporal
hierarchies governing cell-type diversity in the developing human
telencephalon, including distinct excitatory lineages emerging in
rostral and caudal cerebral cortex.},
