 abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is an immensely complex structure that
subserves critical functions that can be disrupted in
developmental and degenerative disorders. Recent innovations in
cellular reprogramming and differentiation techniques have
provided new ways to study the cellular components of the
cerebral cortex. Here, we discuss approaches to generate specific
subtypes of excitatory cortical neurons from pluripotent stem
cells. We review spatial and temporal aspects of cortical neuron
specification that can guide efforts to produce excitatory neuron
subtypes with increased resolution. Finally, we discuss
distinguishing features of human cortical development and their
translational ramifications for cortical stem cell technologies.},
