 abstract = {Evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex underlies many of
our unique mental abilities. This expansion has been attributed
to the increased proliferative potential of radial glia (RG;
neural stem cells) and their subventricular dispersion from the
periventricular niche during neocortical development. Such
adaptations may have evolved through gene expression changes in
RG. However, whether or how RG gene expression varies between
humans and other species is unknown. Here we show that the
transcriptional profiles of human and mouse neocortical RG are
broadly conserved during neurogenesis, yet diverge for specific
signalling pathways. By analysing differential gene co-expression
relationships between the species, we demonstrate that the growth
factor PDGFD is specifically expressed by RG in human, but not
mouse, corticogenesis. We also show that the expression domain of
PDGFR$β$, the cognate receptor for PDGFD, is evolutionarily
divergent, with high expression in the germinal region of dorsal
human neocortex but not in the mouse. Pharmacological inhibition
of PDGFD-PDGFR$β$ signalling in slice culture prevents normal
cell cycle progression of neocortical RG in human, but not mouse.
Conversely, injection of recombinant PDGFD or ectopic expression
of constitutively active PDGFR$β$ in developing mouse
neocortex increases the proportion of RG and their subventricular
dispersion. These findings highlight the requirement of
PDGFD-PDGFR$β$ signalling for human neocortical development
and suggest that local production of growth factors by RG
supports the expanded germinal region and progenitor
heterogeneity of species with large brains.},
