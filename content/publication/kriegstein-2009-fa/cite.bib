 abstract = {About 30% of patient with epilepsy do not respond to available
antiepileptic drugs. In addition to seizure suppression, novel
approaches are needed to prevent or alleviate epileptogenic
process after various types of brain injuries. The use of cell
transplants as factories to produce endogeneous anticonvulsants
or as bricks to repair abnormal ictogenic and epileptogenic
neuronal circuits has generated hope that cell-based therapies
could become a novel therapeutic category in the treatment
arsenal of epilepsy. Herein we summarize the current status and
future perspectives of cell-based therapies in the treatment of
epilepsy.},
