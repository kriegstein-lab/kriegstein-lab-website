 abstract = {Forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells give rise to
glia and olfactory bulb interneurons during early postnatal life
in rats. We investigated the potential of SVZ cells to alter
their fate by transplanting them into a heterotypic neurogenic
and gliogenic environment-the cerebellum. Transplanted cells were
examined 1 to 7 weeks and 6 months post transplantation.
Forebrain progenitors populated the cerebellum and differentiated
into oligodendrocytes, cerebellar-specific Bergmann glia and
velate astrocytes, and neurons. The transplanted cells that
differentiated into neurons maintained an interneuronal fate:
they were GABA-positive, expressed interneuronal markers, such as
calretinin, and exhibited membrane properties that are
characteristic of interneurons. However, the transplanted
interneurons lost the expression of the olfactory bulb
transcription factors Tbr2 and Dlx1, and acquired a
cerebellar-like morphology. Forebrain SVZ progenitors thus have
the potential to adapt to a new environment and integrate into
diverse regions, and may be a useful tool in transplantation
strategies.},
