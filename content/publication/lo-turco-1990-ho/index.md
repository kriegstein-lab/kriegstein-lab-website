abstract: "Whole-cell recordings were made from neurons in neocortical brain slices in order to characterize excitatory synaptic currents mediated by glutamate receptors. Glutamate receptor antagonists, D-aminophosphonovalerate (D-APV) and CNQX, selectively attenuated distinct components in evoked synaptic currents, and were used to differentiate spontaneous synaptic currents mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors. Spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents were independent of action potentials, varied linearly with voltage, and were blocked by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX. An NMDA receptor-mediated component was not apparent in these spontaneous synaptic currents, however, when magnesium was omitted from the recording medium, fluctuations in current and sustained inward current became apparent, and these were blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV. Based on these findings, we conclude that NMDA and non-NMDA receptors are activated differentially by transmitter released independently of action potentials."
