 abstract = {Whole-cell recordings were made from neurons in neocortical brain
slices in order to characterize excitatory synaptic currents
mediated by glutamate receptors. Glutamate receptor antagonists,
D-aminophosphonovalerate (D-APV) and CNQX, selectively attenuated
distinct components in evoked synaptic currents, and were used to
differentiate spontaneous synaptic currents mediated by
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors. Spontaneous
excitatory synaptic currents were independent of action
potentials, varied linearly with voltage, and were blocked by the
non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX. An NMDA receptor-mediated
component was not apparent in these spontaneous synaptic
currents, however, when magnesium was omitted from the recording
medium, fluctuations in current and sustained inward current
became apparent, and these were blocked by the NMDA receptor
antagonist D-APV. Based on these findings, we conclude that NMDA
and non-NMDA receptors are activated differentially by
transmitter released independently of action potentials.},
