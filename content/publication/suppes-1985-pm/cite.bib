 abstract = {Dopamine (DA) application to guinea pig hippocampal CA1 neurons
in vitro causes hyperpolarization of the resting potential,
increase in conductance, and increase in amplitude and duration
of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP). Since these changes could
influence repetitive firing, we performed experiments to
determine whether DA-induced effects would suppress
epileptogenesis in the hippocampus. Epileptiform bursts were
induced by adding penicillin (3.4 mM) to the perfusion medium.
Focal application of DA (40-160 microns) onto CA1 cells (n = 15)
produced a hyperpolarization averaging 4.5 mV beginning in 5-20 s
and lasting up to 3 min. DA also caused an increase in the
amplitude and duration of slow AHPs. The frequency of spontaneous
epileptiform events however was not affected. CA3 neurons (n = 6)
responded to DA application with an initial 1-3 mV depolarization
beginning within 5-30 s and lasting 1-2 min. In 3 cases a small
hyperpolarization lasting several minutes subsequently developed.
AHP duration increased 70% and amplitude increased 35% (n = 4).
Along with these membrane changes the frequency of epileptiform
bursting in CA3 cells slowed for 1-3 min. We added DA (10-80
microM) to the perfusion medium to see whether a significant
decrease in epileptiform burst frequency might occur in the
follower CA1 region if greater numbers of pacemaker CA2 and CA3
cells were exposed to DA. Spontaneous CA1 bursting was reversibly
slowed, the interburst interval became variable and increased
from a mean of 4 to a mean of 5-7 s (n = 6). These results
suggest that DA may play a role in decreasing the incidence or
frequency of epileptogenic discharges in vivo.},
