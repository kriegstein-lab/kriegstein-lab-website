 abstract = {The mammalian cerebral cortex is the most cellularly complex
structure in the animal kingdom. Almost all cortical neurons are
produced during a limited embryonic period by cortical progenitor
cells in a proliferative region that surrounds the ventricular
system of the developing brain. The proliferative region
comprises 2 distinct zones, the ventricular zone, which is a
neuroepithelial layer directly adjacent to the ventricular lumen,
and the subventricular zone, which is positioned superficial to
the ventricular zone. Recent advances in molecular and cell
biology have made possible the study of specific cell
populations, and 2 cortical progenitor cell types, radial glial
cells in the ventricular zone and intermediate progenitor cells
in the subventricular zone, have been shown to generate neurons
in the embryonic cerebral cortex. These findings have refined our
understanding of cortical neurogenesis, with implications for
understanding the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and for
their potential treatment.},
