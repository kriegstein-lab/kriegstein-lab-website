 abstract = {New neurons continue to be generated in the subgranular zone of
the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus. This
process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and
exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease.
In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new
neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas
other studies find many fewer putative new neurons. Despite these
discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human
hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that
a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the
subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We
also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young
neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first
year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed
by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and
healthy adults (18-77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from
controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with
epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus.
In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of
neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal
life, but this diminished during juvenile development as
neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young
neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the
first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus
does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The
early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about
how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and
other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is
preserved.},
