 abstract = {To obtain electrophysiological recordings in brain slices,
sophisticated and expensive pieces of equipment can be used.
However, costly microscope equipment with infrared differential
interference contrast optics is not always necessary or even
desirable. For instance, obtaining a randomized unbiased sample
in a given preparation would be better accomplished if cells were
not directly visualized before recording. In addition, some
preparations require thick slices, and direct visualization is
not possible. Here we describe a protocol for the 'blind patch
clamp method' that we developed several years ago to perform
electrophysiological recordings in mammalian brain slices using a
standard patch clamp amplifier, dissecting microscope and
recording chamber. Overall, it takes approximately 3-4 h to set
up this procedure.},
