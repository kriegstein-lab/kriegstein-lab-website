abstract: "To obtain electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, sophisticated and expensive pieces of equipment can be used. However, costly microscope equipment with infrared differential interference contrast optics is not always necessary or even desirable. For instance, obtaining a randomized unbiased sample in a given preparation would be better accomplished if cells were not directly visualized before recording. In addition, some preparations require thick slices, and direct visualization is not possible. Here we describe a protocol for the 'blind patch clamp method' that we developed several years ago to perform electrophysiological recordings in mammalian brain slices using a standard patch clamp amplifier, dissecting microscope and recording chamber. Overall, it takes approximately 3-4 h to set up this procedure."
