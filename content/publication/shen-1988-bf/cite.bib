 abstract = {The whole-cell patch-clamp method was used to study the
development of functional GABA receptors in cortical neurons
dissociated from embryonic turtles. GABA elicited an increase in
membrane conductance, even from cells obtained from the earliest
stages of corticogenesis. The GABA-mediated conductance had a
mean value 7.4 times greater than membrane 'leak' conductance and
increased with developmental age. In all stages studied, the
response inverted polarity at a value approximating ECl- and was
blocked by applications of bicuculline, suggesting that it was
mediated by GABAA receptors. GABA receptors are thus present and
functional very early in corticogenesis, preceding
electrogenesis, synaptogenesis, and full neuronal
differentiation.},
