 abstract = {The homeobox transcription factor, Nkx2-1, plays multiple roles
during forebrain development. Using restricted genetic ablation
of Nkx2-1, in this issue of Neuron, Butt et al. show that Nkx2-1
in telencephalic progenitors regulates interneuron subtype
specification, while NÃ³brega-Pereira et al. demonstrate that
postmitotic Nkx2-1 regulates migration and sorting of
interneurons to the striatum or cortex by controlling the
expression of the guidance receptor, Neuropilin-2.},
