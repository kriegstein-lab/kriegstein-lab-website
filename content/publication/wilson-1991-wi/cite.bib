 abstract = {Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in turtle and
mammalian cortex. In high concentrations it is toxic to mammalian
neurons and is an important mediator in the pathway that leads to
neuronal death from anoxia. Turtle neurons are remarkably
resistant to anoxic injury and we sought to determine whether
part of this resistance could be attributed to the sensitivity of
turtle neurons to glutamate toxicity. Embryonic turtle cortical
neurons were grown for 25 days in dissociated cell culture using
a modification of a method developed for murine cortical cell
culture. Turtle neurons in dissociated culture were found to
express glutamate receptors which include both
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptor types.
Remarkably, these neurons survive 5 minute exposures to glutamate
in concentrations up to 3 mM, doses 30 times the LD50 and 6 times
the LD100 for mouse cortical neurons. Elucidating the mechanism
for this resistance may suggest new strategies for brain
protection.},
