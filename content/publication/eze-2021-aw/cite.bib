 abstract = {The human cortex comprises diverse cell types that emerge from an
initially uniform neuroepithelium that gives rise to radial glia,
the neural stem cells of the cortex. To characterize the earliest
stages of human brain development, we performed single-cell
RNA-sequencing across regions of the developing human brain,
including the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain
and cerebellum. We identify nine progenitor populations
physically proximal to the telencephalon, suggesting more
heterogeneity than previously described, including a highly
prevalent mesenchymal-like population that disappears once
neurogenesis begins. Comparison of human and mouse progenitor
populations at corresponding stages identifies two progenitor
clusters that are enriched in the early stages of human cortical
development. We also find that organoid systems display low
fidelity to neuroepithelial and early radial glia cell types, but
improve as neurogenesis progresses. Overall, we provide a
comprehensive molecular and spatial atlas of early stages of
human brain and cortical development.},
