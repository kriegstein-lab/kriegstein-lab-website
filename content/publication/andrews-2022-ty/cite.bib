 abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
readily infects a variety of cell types impacting the function of
vital organ systems, with particularly severe impact on
respiratory function. Neurological symptoms, which range in
severity, accompany as many as one-third of COVID-19 cases,
indicating a potential vulnerability of neural cell types. To
assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by
SARS-CoV-2, we utilized stem-cell-derived cortical organoids as
well as primary human cortical tissue, both from developmental
and adult stages. We find significant and predominant infection
in cortical astrocytes in both primary tissue and organoid
cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations.
Infected and bystander astrocytes have a corresponding increase
in inflammatory gene expression, reactivity characteristics,
increased cytokine and growth factor signaling, and cellular
stress. Although human cortical cells, particularly astrocytes,
have no observable ACE2 expression, we find high levels of
coronavirus coreceptors in infected astrocytes, including CD147
and DPP4. Decreasing coreceptor abundance and activity reduces
overall infection rate, and increasing expression is sufficient
to promote infection. Thus, we find tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for
human astrocytes resulting in inflammatory gliosis-type injury
that is dependent on coronavirus coreceptors.},
