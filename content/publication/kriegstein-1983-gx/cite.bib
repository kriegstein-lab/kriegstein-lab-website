 abstract = {Neurons in ``mature'' (4- to 6-week-old) dissociated cell
cultures of 15-day gestational age rat fetal cortex were injected
with Lucifer Yellow in order to compare their detailed
morphological features with those of cortical neurons in situ,
and in order to determine which features of cellular morphology
were dependent on local environmental conditions. Neurons were
characterized by their cell form (pyramidal, multipolar,
fusiform, etc.), dendritic branching pattern, spine density, and
axonal projections. The neurons in culture appeared to display
all the morphological features seen in cortical neurons in situ.
These characteristics appeared to be independent of whether an
individual neuron grew in a dense or sparse region of the
culture. In addition, examination of neurons during early
differentiation indicated that many of their morphological
features developed as soon as the neurons could be recognized and
before extensive synapse formation occurred.},
