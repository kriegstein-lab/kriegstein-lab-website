 abstract = {In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions
primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act
as a trophic factor during nervous system development to
influence events such as proliferation, migration,
differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates
these processes by the activation of traditional ionotropic and
metabotropic receptors, and probably by both synaptic and
non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional properties of
GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly
different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the
adult brain. The unique features of the early-appearing GABA
signalling systems might help to explain how GABA acts as a
developmental signal.},
