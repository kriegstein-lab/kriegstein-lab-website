 abstract = {Before synapses form in embryonic turtle cerebral cortex, an
endogenous neurotransmitter activates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
channels on neurons in the cortical plate. Throughout cortical
development, these channels exhibit voltage-dependent Mg2+
blockade and are antagonized by D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric
acid, a selective NMDA receptor antagonist. The activation in
situ of these nonsynaptic NMDA channels demonstrates a potential
physiological substrate for control of early neuronal
differentiation.},
