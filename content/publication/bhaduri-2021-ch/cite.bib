 abstract = {The lipidome is currently understudied but fundamental to life.
Within the brain, little is known about cell-type lipid
heterogeneity, and even less is known about cell-to-cell lipid
diversity because it is difficult to study the lipids within
individual cells. Here, we used single-cell mass
spectrometry-based protocols to profile the lipidomes of 154 910
single cells across ten individuals consisting of five
developmental ages and five brain regions, resulting in a unique
lipid atlas available via a web browser of the developing human
brain. From these data, we identify differentially expressed
lipids across brain structures, cortical areas, and developmental
ages. We inferred lipid profiles of several major cell types from
this data set and additionally detected putative cell-type
specific lipids. This data set will enable further interrogation
of the developing human brain lipidome.},
