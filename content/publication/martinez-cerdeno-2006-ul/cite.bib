 abstract = {The vertebrate cerebral cortex varies from the 3-layered dorsal
cortex of reptiles to the 6-layered lissencephalic cortex
characteristic of rodents and to the 6-layered gyrencephalic
cortex typical of carnivores and primates. Distinct developmental
mechanisms may have evolved independently to account for the
radial expansion that produced the multilayered cortex of mammals
and for the tangential expansion of cortical surface area that
resulted in gyrencephalic cortex. Recent evidence shows that
during the late stages of cortical development, radial glial
cells divide asymmetrically in the ventricular zone to generate
radial glial cells and intermediate progenitor (IP) cells and
that IP cells subsequently divide symmetrically in the
subventricular zone to produce multiple neurons. We propose that
the evolution of this two-step pattern of neurogenesis played an
important role in the amplification of cell numbers underlying
the radial and tangential expansion of the cerebral cortex.},
