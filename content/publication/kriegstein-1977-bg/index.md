abstract: "In order to study the development of the nervous system of the marine mollusc, Aplysia californica, it is necessary objectively to assess the maturity of individual specimens. This can be done by defining stages in the life cycle. The post-hatching development can be divided into four phases: planktonic, metamorphic, juvenile, and adult. These phases can be further subdivided into 13 stages on the basis of behavioral and morphological characteristics visible in living specimens: Stage 1, newly hatched; Stage 2, eyes develop; Stage 3, the larval heart beats; Stage 4, maximum shell size is reached; Stage 5, the propodium develops; Stage 6, red spots appear; Stage 7, the velum is shed; Stage 8, eyebrows appear; Stage 9, pink color develops; Stage 10, white spots appear; Stage 11, rhinophores grow; Stage 12, the genital groove forms; Stage 13, egg laying begins. Reconstructions from serial sections taken from specimens fixed at each of these stages reveal the sequence of formation of the major organ systems. The nervous system develops gradually. The cerebral and pedal ganglia are present at Stage 1, the optic ganglia develop at Stage 2, the abdominal, pleural, and osphradial ganglia at Stage 3, the buccal ganglia at Stage 5, and the genital ganglion at Stage 13. Because Aplysia develops gradually, it is possible to analyze the contribution which gastropod torsion makes to the different phases of the life cycle. The Aplysia embryo undergoes 120 degrees torsion prior to Stage 1. The major visceral organs, the digestive system, heart, gill, and visceral nervous system, develop sybsequently in their post-torsional positions. After metamorphosis, there is a partial de-torsion which involves only the digestive system. Torsion of the digestive system may therefore be beneficial only to the pre-metamorphic larva, and not to the postmetamorphic juvenile."
