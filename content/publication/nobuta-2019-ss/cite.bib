 abstract = {Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked leukodystrophy
caused by mutations in Proteolipid Protein 1 (PLP1), encoding a
major myelin protein, resulting in profound developmental delay
and early lethality. Previous work showed involvement of unfolded
protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
pathways, but poor PLP1 genotype-phenotype associations suggest
additional pathogenetic mechanisms. Using induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC) and gene-correction, we show that
patient-derived oligodendrocytes can develop to the
pre-myelinating stage, but subsequently undergo cell death.
Mutant oligodendrocytes demonstrated key hallmarks of ferroptosis
including lipid peroxidation, abnormal iron metabolism, and
hypersensitivity to free iron. Iron chelation rescued mutant
oligodendrocyte apoptosis, survival, and differentiationin vitro,
and post-transplantation in vivo. Finally, systemic treatment of
Plp1 mutant Jimpy mice with deferiprone, a small molecule iron
chelator, reduced oligodendrocyte apoptosis and enabled myelin
formation. Thus, oligodendrocyte iron-induced cell death and
myelination is rescued by iron chelation in PMD pre-clinical
models.},
