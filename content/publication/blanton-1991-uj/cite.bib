 abstract = {We used loose-patch and whole-cell recording techniques to study
the development of spontaneous action potential activity and
spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in
embryonic neurons in the cerebral hemispheres of turtles.
Sporadic action potential activity appeared early in development
at stage 17, soon after morphologically identifiable pyramidal
and nonpyramidal neurons were first observed in the cortex. As
the cortical plate matured in midembryonic stages, action
potential activity became more regular and fell into one of two
distinct patterns, tonic and intermittent high-frequency firing.
Spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents
(EPSCs and IPSCs) appeared at developmental stages 18 and 20,
respectively, after action potential activity was established.
EPSCs and IPSCs exhibited characteristic ionic dependence and
pharmacology throughout development. EPSCs reversed in direction
at the equilibrium potential for cations and were sensitive to
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, an antagonist of the
non-NMDA type of glutamate receptor. IPSCs reversed at the
equilibrium potential for chloride and were sensitive to
bicuculline methiodide, a GABAA receptor antagonist. Spontaneous
synaptic currents differed in their time course of development
and in waveform parameters. Spontaneous synaptic currents
differed in their time course of development and in waveform
parameters. Spontaneous EPSCs appeared at stage 18 and increased
progressively in frequency, from 0.2 +/- 0.1 Hz at stage 20 to
3.2 +/- 2.0 Hz at stage 26 (hatching), while spontaneous IPSCs
appeared at stage 20 and surpassed EPSCs in frequency, increasing
to 7.1 +/- 1.6 Hz at stage 26. EPSCs exhibited stable amplitudes
during development, with a mean conductance of 126 +/- 20 pS at
stage 26, while IPSCs increased in mean amplitude, from 180 +/-
12 pS at stage 18 to 260 +/- 44 pS at stage 26. The rise time to
peak conductance of both types of synaptic currents increased
with developmental time, for EPSCs increasing from 1.5 +/- 0.5
msec at stage 20 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 msec at stage 26 and for IPSCs
increasing from 2.9 +/- 0.2 msec at stage 18 to 6.2 +/- 0.8 msec
at stage 26. While the decay time constants increased for EPSCs,
from 3.9 +/- 1.2 msec at stage 20 to 8.7 +/- 2.3 msec at stage
26, decay time constants for IPSCs showed a decreasing trend from
24.0 +/- 5.2 msec at stage 18 to 18.4 +/- 5.3 msec at stage 26.
The excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents were sensitive to
the sodium channel blocker TTX and were thus dependent, in part,
on spontaneous action potential activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT
