 abstract = {Mutations in the human LIS1 gene cause the smooth brain disease
classical lissencephaly. To understand the underlying mechanisms,
we conducted in situ live cell imaging analysis of LIS1 function
throughout the entire radial migration pathway. In utero
electroporation of LIS1 small interference RNA and short hairpin
dominant negative LIS1 and dynactin cDNAs caused a dramatic
accumulation of multipolar progenitor cells within the
subventricular zone of embryonic rat brains. This effect resulted
from a complete failure in progression from the multipolar to the
migratory bipolar state, as revealed by time-lapse analysis of
brain slices. Surprisingly, interkinetic nuclear oscillations in
the radial glial progenitors were also abolished, as were cell
divisions at the ventricular surface. Those few bipolar cells
that reached the intermediate zone also exhibited a complete
block in somal translocation, although, remarkably, process
extension persisted. Finally, axonal growth also ceased. These
results identify multiple distinct and novel roles for LIS1 in
nucleokinesis and process dynamics and suggest that nuclear
position controls neural progenitor cell division.},
