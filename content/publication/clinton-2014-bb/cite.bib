 abstract = {To better understand the role of radial glial (RG) cells in the
evolution of the mammalian cerebral cortex, we investigated the
role of RG cells in the dorsal cortex and dorsal ventricular
ridge of the turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans. Unlike mammals,
the glial architecture of adult reptile consists mainly of
ependymoradial glia, which share features with mammalian RG
cells, and which may contribute to neurogenesis that continues
throughout the lifespan of the turtle. To evaluate the morphology
and proliferative capacity of ependymoradial glia (here referred
to as RG cells) in the dorsal cortex of embryonic and adult
turtle, we adapted the cortical electroporation technique,
commonly used in rodents, to the turtle telencephalon. Here, we
demonstrate the morphological and functional characteristics of
RG cells in the developing turtle dorsal cortex. We show that
cell division occurs both at the ventricle and away from the
ventricle, that RG cells undergo division at the ventricle during
neurogenic stages of development, and that mitotic Tbr2+
precursor cells, a hallmark of the mammalian SVZ, are present in
the turtle cortex. In the adult turtle, we show that RG cells
encompass a morphologically heterogeneous population,
particularly in the subpallium where proliferation is most
prevalent. One RG subtype is similar to RG cells in the
developing mammalian cortex, while 2 other RG subtypes appear to
be distinct from those seen in mammal. We propose that the
different subtypes of RG cells in the adult turtle perform
distinct functions.},
