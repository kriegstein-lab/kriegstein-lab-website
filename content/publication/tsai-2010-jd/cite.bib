 abstract = {Radial glial progenitor cells exhibit bidirectional cell
cycle-dependent nuclear oscillations. The purpose and underlying
mechanism of this unusual 'interkinetic nuclear migration' are
poorly understood. We investigated the basis for this behavior by
live imaging of nuclei, centrosomes and microtubules in embryonic
rat brain slices, coupled with the use of RNA interference (RNAi)
and the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin. We found that nuclei
migrated independent of centrosomes and unidirectionally away
from or toward the ventricular surface along microtubules, which
were uniformly oriented from the ventricular surface to the pial
surface of the brain. RNAi directed against cytoplasmic dynein
specifically inhibited nuclear movement toward the apical
surface. An RNAi screen of kinesin genes identified Kif1a, a
member of the kinesin-3 family, as the motor for basally directed
nuclear movement. These observations provide direct evidence that
kinesins are involved in nuclear migration and neurogenesis and
suggest that a cell cycle-dependent switch between distinct
microtubule motors drives interkinetic nuclear migration.},
