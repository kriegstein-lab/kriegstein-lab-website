 abstract = {The distribution of muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors was
investigated in the turtle forebrain by the technique of in vitro
receptor autoradiography. Muscarinic binding sites were labeled
with 1 nM 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB), and benzodiazepine
sites were demonstrated with the aid of 1 nM 3H-flunitrazepam
(3H-FLU). Autoradiograms generated on 3H-Ultrofilm apposed to
tissue slices revealed regionally specific distributions of
muscarinic and benzodiazepine binding sites that are comparable
with those for mammalian brain. Dense benzodiazepine binding was
found in the anterior olfactory nucleus, the lateral and dorsal
cortices, and the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), a structure
with no clear mammalian homologue. Muscarinic binding sites were
most dense in the striatum, accumbens, DVR, lateral geniculate,
and the anterior olfactory nucleus. Cortical binding sites were
studied in greater detail by quantitative analysis of
autoradiograms generated by using emulsion-coated coverslips.
Laminar gradients of binding were observed that were specific for
each radioligand; 3H-QNB sites were most dense in the inner
molecular layer in all cortical regions, whereas 3H-FLU binding
was generally most concentrated in the outer molecular layer and
was least dense through all layers in the dorsomedial cortex.
Because pyramidal cells are arranged in register in turtle
cortex, the laminar patterns of receptor binding may reflect
different receptor density gradients along pyramidal cell
dendrites.},
