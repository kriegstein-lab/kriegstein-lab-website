abstract: "We describe methods for obtaining stable, whole-cell recordings from neurons in brain hemispheres from turtles and in brain slices from rats and turtles. Synaptic currents and membrane properties of central neurons can be studied in voltage and current clamp in cells maintained within their endogenous synaptic circuits. The methods described here are compatible with unmodified dissecting microscopes and recording chambers, and with brain slices of standard thickness (400-500 microns)."
