 abstract = {We describe methods for obtaining stable, whole-cell recordings
from neurons in brain hemispheres from turtles and in brain
slices from rats and turtles. Synaptic currents and membrane
properties of central neurons can be studied in voltage and
current clamp in cells maintained within their endogenous
synaptic circuits. The methods described here are compatible with
unmodified dissecting microscopes and recording chambers, and
with brain slices of standard thickness (400-500 microns).},
