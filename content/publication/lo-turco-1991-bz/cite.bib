 abstract = {The neocortex of the brain develops from a simple germinal layer
into a complex multilayer structure. To investigate cellular
interactions during early neocortical development, whole-cell
patch clamp recordings were made from neuroblasts in the
ventricular zone of fetal rats. During early corticogenesis,
neuroblasts are physiologically coupled by gap junctions into
clusters of 15 to 90 cells. The coupled cells form columns within
the ventricular zone and, by virtue of their membership in
clusters, have low apparent membrane resistances and generate
large responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter
gamma-aminobutyric acid. As neuronal migration out of the
ventricular zone progresses, the number of cells within the
clusters decreases. These clusters allow direct cell to cell
interaction at the earliest stages of corticogenesis.},
