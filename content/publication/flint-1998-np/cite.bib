 abstract = {Glycine receptors (GlyRs) contribute to fast inhibitory synaptic
transmission in the brain stem and spinal cord. GlyR subunits are
expressed in the developing neocortex, but a neurotransmitter
system involving cortical GlyRs has yet to be demonstrated. Here,
we show that GlyRs in immature neocortex are excitatory and
activated by a nonsynaptically released endogenous ligand. Of the
potential ligands for cortical GlyRs, taurine is by far the most
abundant in the developing neocortex. We found that taurine is
stored in immature cortical neurons and that manipulations known
to elevate extracellular taurine cause GlyR activation. These
data indicate that nonsynaptically released taurine activates
GlyRs during neocortical development. As fetal taurine
deprivation can cause cortical dysgenesis, it is possible that
taurine influences neocortical development by activating GlyRs.},
