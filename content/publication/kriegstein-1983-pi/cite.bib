 abstract = {Acetylcholine (1-20 mM) was applied to guinea pig hippocampal
slices bathed in normal and penicillin-containing media.
Recordings in the CA 1 pyramidal cell layer in the presence of
penicillin showed that acetylcholine caused a prolonged
enhancement of the extracellular field potential. Intracellular
recordings documented an increase in duration of cell bursting, a
decrease in burst afterhyperpolarization, and a membrane
depolarization lasting 1-5 min. These results suggest that the
actions of acetylcholine to increase membrane excitability
interact with penicillin-induced disinhibition to enhance
hippocampal epileptogenesis.},
