 abstract = {Outer radial glial (oRG) cells are a population of neural stem
cells prevalent in the developing human cortex that contribute to
its cellular diversity and evolutionary expansion. The mammalian
Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is active in human
oRG cells. Mutations in mTOR pathway genes are linked to a
variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of
cortical development. We find that dysregulation of mTOR
signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other
progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the
activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG
cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but do not
affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can
regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by
maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the
radial glia scaffold. Our study provides insight into how mTOR
dysregulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.},
