 abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive
type of primary brain tumor. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors are frequently
amplified and/or possess gain-of-function mutations in GBM
However, clinical trials of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors have shown
disappointing efficacy, in part due to intra-tumor heterogeneity.
To assess the effect of clonal heterogeneity on gene expression,
we derived an approach to map single-cell expression profiles to
sequentially acquired mutations identified from exome sequencing.
Using 288 single cells, we constructed high-resolution
phylogenies of EGF-driven and PDGF-driven GBMs, modeling
transcriptional kinetics during tumor evolution. Descending the
phylogenetic tree of a PDGF-driven tumor corresponded to a
progressive induction of an oligodendrocyte progenitor-like cell
type, expressing pro-angiogenic factors. In contrast,
phylogenetic analysis of an EGFR-amplified tumor showed an
up-regulation of pro-invasive genes. An in-frame deletion in a
specific dimerization domain of PDGF receptor correlates with an
up-regulation of growth pathways in a proneural GBM and enhances
proliferation when ectopically expressed in glioma cell lines.
In-frame deletions in this domain are frequent in public GBM
data.},
