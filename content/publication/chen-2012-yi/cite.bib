 abstract = {Polarization of mammalian neurons with a specified axon requires
precise regulation of microtubule and actin dynamics in the
developing neurites. Here we show that mammalian partition
defective 3 (mPar3), a key component of the Par polarity complex
that regulates the polarization of many cell types including
neurons, directly regulates microtubule stability and
organization. The N-terminal portion of mPar3 exhibits strong
microtubule binding, bundling, and stabilization activity, which
can be suppressed by its C-terminal portion via an intramolecular
interaction. Interestingly, the intermolecular oligomerization of
mPar3 is able to relieve the intramolecular interaction and
thereby promote microtubule bundling and stabilization.
Furthermore, disruption of this microtubule regulatory activity
of mPar3 impairs its function in axon specification. Together,
these results demonstrate a role for mPar3 in directly regulating
microtubule organization that is crucial for neuronal
polarization.},
