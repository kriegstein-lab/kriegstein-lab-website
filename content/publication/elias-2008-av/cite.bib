 abstract = {The morphological development of the cerebral cortex from a
primitive neuroepithelium into a complex laminar structure
underlying higher cognition must rely on a network of
intercellular signaling. Gap junctions are widely expressed
during embryonic development and provide a means of cell-cell
contact and communication. We review the roles of gap junctions
in regulating the proliferation of neural progenitors as well as
the migration and differentiation of young neurons in the
embryonic cerebral cortex. There is substantial evidence that
although gap junctions act in the classical manner coupling
neural progenitors, they also act as hemichannels mediating the
spread of calcium waves across progenitor cell populations and as
adhesive molecules aiding neuronal migration. Gap junctions are
thus emerging as multifaceted regulators of cortical development
playing diverse roles in intercellular communication.},
