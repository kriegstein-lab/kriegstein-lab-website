 abstract = {In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Falk and colleagues (Falk et
al., 2008) demonstrate that differential responsiveness to
TGF-beta signaling selectively modulates self-renewal of dorsal
midbrain stem cells. This observation may lead to strategies for
expanding specific neural stem cell subtypes.},
