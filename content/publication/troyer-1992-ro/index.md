abstract: "Focal, freeze-induced lesions were made in isolated hemispheres of turtle cerebral cortex in vitro, permitting the investigation of epileptiform discharges in a preparation with preserved intracortical circuitry. Freeze lesions resulted in interictal discharges and occasional ictal-like events. The interictal discharges were dependent upon activation of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors and were affected by but did not require NMDA receptor activation. Voltage clamp and current clamp recordings revealed abnormal bursts of low-amplitude action potentials in 36% of recorded neurons, while large, repetitive inhibitory potentials, mediated by GABAA receptors, were recorded in 90% of the neurons. Thus, prominent findings in this model include abnormalities of both excitatory and inhibitory activity. Since these changes in neuronal excitability resulted from a localized physical injury, they may resemble the changes that occur in acute posttraumatic epilepsy."
