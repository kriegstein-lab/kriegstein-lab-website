 abstract = {We investigated a strategy to ameliorate the motor symptoms of
rats that received 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions, a rodent
model of Parkinson's disease, through transplantation of
embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) cells into the
striatum. During brain development, embryonic MGE cells migrate
into the striatum and neocortex where they mature into GABAergic
interneurons and play a key role in establishing the balance
between excitation and inhibition. Unlike most other embryonic
neurons, MGE cells retain the capacity for migration and
integration when transplanted into the postnatal and adult brain.
We performed MGE cell transplantation into the basal ganglia of
control and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Transplanted MGE cells
survived, differentiated into GABA(+) neurons, integrated into
host circuitry, and modified motor behavior in both lesioned and
control rats. Our data suggest that MGE cell transplantation into
the striatum is a promising approach to investigate the potential
benefits of remodeling basal ganglia circuitry in
neurodegenerative diseases.},
