 abstract = {Innovations in organoid-based models of human tissues have made
them an exciting experimental platform for studying development
and disease. However, these models require systematic
benchmarking against primary tissue to establish their value. We
discuss key parameters that impact the utility of organoid
models, primarily focusing on cerebral organoids as examples.},
