 abstract = {Understanding the development and dysfunction of the human brain
is a major goal of neurobiology. Much of our current
understanding of human brain development has been derived from
the examination of post-mortem and pathological specimens,
bolstered by observations of developing non-human primates and
experimental studies focused largely on mouse models. However,
these tissue specimens and model systems cannot fully capture the
unique and dynamic features of human brain development. Recent
advances in stem cell technologies that enable the generation of
human brain organoids from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) promise
to profoundly change our understanding of the development of the
human brain and enable a detailed study of the pathogenesis of
inherited and acquired brain diseases.},
