 abstract = {Genomic association studies of common or rare protein-coding
variation have established robust statistical approaches to
account for multiple testing. Here we present a comparable
framework to evaluate rare and de novo noncoding
single-nucleotide variants, insertion/deletions, and all classes
of structural variation from whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Integrating genomic annotations at the level of nucleotides,
genes, and regulatory regions, we define 51,801 annotation
categories. Analyses of 519 autism spectrum disorder families did
not identify association with any categories after correction for
4,123 effective tests. Without appropriate correction,
biologically plausible associations are observed in both cases
and controls. Despite excluding previously identified
gene-disrupting mutations, coding regions still exhibited the
strongest associations. Thus, in autism, the contribution of de
novo noncoding variation is probably modest in comparison to that
of de novo coding variants. Robust results from future WGS
studies will require large cohorts and comprehensive analytical
strategies that consider the substantial multiple-testing burden.},
