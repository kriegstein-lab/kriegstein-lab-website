 abstract = {The human amygdala grows during childhood, and its abnormal
development is linked to mood disorders. The primate amygdala
contains a large population of immature neurons in the
paralaminar nuclei (PL), suggesting protracted development and
possibly neurogenesis. Here we studied human PL development from
embryonic stages to adulthood. The PL develops next to the caudal
ganglionic eminence, which generates inhibitory interneurons, yet
most PL neurons express excitatory markers. In children, most PL
cells are immature (DCX+PSA-NCAM+), and during adolescence many
transition into mature (TBR1+VGLUT2+) neurons. Immature PL
neurons persist into old age, yet local progenitor proliferation
sharply decreases in infants. Using single nuclei RNA sequencing,
we identify the transcriptional profile of immature excitatory
neurons in the human amygdala between 4-15 years. We conclude
that the human PL contains excitatory neurons that remain
immature for decades, a possible substrate for persistent
plasticity at the interface of the hippocampus and amygdala.},
