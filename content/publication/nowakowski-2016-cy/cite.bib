 abstract = {The classic view of cortical development, embodied in the radial
unit hypothesis, highlights the ventricular radial glia (vRG)
scaffold as a key architectonic feature of the developing
neocortex. The scaffold includes continuous fibers spanning the
thickness of the developing cortex during neurogenesis across
mammals. However, we find that in humans, the scaffold transforms
into a physically discontinuous structure during the transition
from infragranular to supragranular neuron production. As a
consequence of this transformation, supragranular layer neurons
arrive at their terminal positions in the cortical plate along
outer radial glia (oRG) cell fibers. In parallel, the radial glia
that contact the ventricle develop distinct gene expression
profile and ``truncated'' morphology. We propose a supragranular
layer expansion hypothesis that posits a deterministic role of
oRG cells in the radial and tangential expansion of supragranular
layers in primates, with implications for patterns of neuronal
migration, area patterning, and cortical folding.},
