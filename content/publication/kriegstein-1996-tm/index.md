abstract: "Proliferative cells lining the cerebral ventricles generate all of the phenotypically diverse neurons of the adult cortex. Recent evidence indicates that cell cycle events of neuronal precursor cells are under the influence of neurotransmitters and a variety of signaling factors. The newly discovered environmental factors that regulate neurogenesis promise to expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for cerebral malformations and disorders of cortical organization."
