 abstract = {Apical-basal progenitor cell polarity establishes key features of
the radial and laminar architecture of the developing human
cortex. The unique diversity of cortical stem cell populations
and an expansion of progenitor population size in the human
cortex have been mirrored by an increase in the complexity of
cellular processes that regulate stem cell morphology and
behaviour, including their polarity. The study of human cells in
primary tissue samples and human stem cell-derived model systems
(such as cortical organoids) has provided insight into these
processes, revealing that protein complexes regulate progenitor
polarity by controlling cell membrane adherence within
appropriate cortical niches and are themselves regulated by
cytoskeletal proteins, signalling molecules and receptors, and
cellular organelles. Studies exploring how cortical stem cell
polarity is established and maintained are key for understanding
the features of human brain development and have implications for
neurological dysfunction.},
