 abstract = {Accurate RNA quantification at the single-cell level is critical
for understanding the dynamics of gene expression and regulation
across space and time. Single molecule FISH (smFISH), such as
RNAscope, provides spatial and quantitative measurements of
individual transcripts, therefore, can be used to explore
differential gene expression among a heterogeneous cell
population if combined with cell identify information. However,
such analysis is not straightforward, and existing image analysis
pipelines cannot integrate both RNA transcripts and cellular
staining information to automatically output cell type-specific
gene expression. We developed an efficient and customizable
analysis method, Single-Molecule Automatic RNA Transcription
Quantification (SMART-Q), to enable the analysis of gene
transcripts in a cell type-specific manner. SMART-Q efficiently
infers cell identity information from multiplexed immuno-staining
and quantifies cell type-specific transcripts using a 3D Gaussian
fitting algorithm. Furthermore, we have optimized SMART-Q for
user experiences, such as flexible parameters specification,
batch data outputs, and visualization of analysis results.
SMART-Q meets the demands for efficient quantification of
single-molecule RNA and can be widely used for cell type-specific
RNA transcript analysis.},
