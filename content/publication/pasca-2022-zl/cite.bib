 abstract = {Self-organizing three-dimensional cellular models derived from
human pluripotent stem cells or primary tissue have great
potential to provide insights into how the human nervous system
develops, what makes it unique and how disorders of the nervous
system arise, progress and could be treated. Here, to facilitate
progress and improve communication with the scientific community
and the public, we clarify and provide a basic framework for the
nomenclature of human multicellular models of nervous system
development and disease, including organoids, assembloids and
transplants.},
