 abstract = {In order to learn more about the anatomical substrate for
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition in cortical
structures, the intrinsic neuronal organization of turtle dorsal
cortex was studied by using Golgi impregnation,
immunohistochemical localization of GABA and its synthetic enzyme
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and histochemical localization
of the presynaptic GABA-degrading enzyme GABA-transaminase
(GABA-T). GABAergic markers are found in neurons identical in
morphology and distribution to Golgi-impregnated aspiny and
sparsely spiny nonpyramidal neurons with locally arborizing axons
and appear to label most if not all of the nonpyramidal neurons.
In addition, the GABAergic markers are found in punctate
structures in a distribution characteristic of presumed
inhibitory terminals. The spine-laden pyramidal neurons, the
principal projecting cell type in the dorsal cortex, are devoid
of labelling for GABAergic markers but are surrounded by presumed
GABAergic terminals. The data complement previous physiological
and ultrastructural studies that implicate aspiny and sparsely
spiny nonpyramidal neurons as mediators of intrinsic inhibition
of pyramidal neurons in turtle cortex. The results also suggest
similarities in the functional organization of intrinsic
inhibitory elements in turtle and mammalian cortex.},
