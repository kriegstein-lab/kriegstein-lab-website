abstract: "Pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons can be recognized early in the development of the cerebral cortex in both reptiles and mammals, and the neurotransmitters likely utilized by these cells, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, have been suggested to play critical developmental roles. Information concerning the timing and topography of neurotransmitter synthesis by specific classes of cortical neurons is important for understanding developmental roles of neurotransmitters and for identifying potential zones of neurotransmitter action in the developing brain. We therefore analyzed the appearance of GABA and glutamate in the cerebral cortex of embryonic turtles using polyclonal antisera raised against GABA and glutamate. Neuronal subtypes become immunoreactive for the putative amino acid neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate early in the embryonic development of turtle cerebral cortex, with nonpyramidal cells immunoreactive for GABA and pyramidal cells immunoreactive for glutamate. The results of controls strongly suggest that the immunocytochemical staining in tissue sections by the GABA and glutamate antisera corresponds to fixed endogenous GABA and glutamate. Horizontally oriented cells in the early marginal zone (stages 15-16) that are GABA-immunoreactive (GABA-IR) resemble nonpyramidal cells in morphology and distribution. GABA-IR neurons exhibit increasingly diverse morphologies and become distributed in all cortical layers as the cortex matures. Glutamate-immunoreactive (Glu-IR) cells dominate the cellular layer throughout development and are also common in the subcellular layer at early stages, a distribution like that of pyramidal neurons and distinct from that of GABA-IR nonpyramidal cells. The early organization of embryonic turtle cortex in reptiles resembles that of embryonic mammalian cortex, and the immunocytochemical results underline several shared as well as distinguishing features. Early GABA-IR nonpyramidal cells flank the developing cortical plate, composed primarily of pyramidal cells, shown here to be Glu-IR. The earliest GABA-IR cells in turtles likely correspond to Cajal-Retzius cells, a ubiquitous and precocious cell type in vertebrate cortex. Glutamate-IR projection neurons in vertebrates may also be related. The distinctly different topographies of GABA and glutamate containing cells in reptiles and mammals indicate that even if the basic amino acid transmitter-containing cell types are conserved in higher vertebrates, the local interactions mediated by these transmitters may differ. The potential role of GABA and glutamate in nonsynaptic interactions early in cortical development is reinforced by the precocious expression of these neurotransmitters in turtles, well before they are required for synaptic transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
