 abstract = {As a starting point for understanding the development of the
cerebral cortex in reptiles and for determining how reptilian
cortical development compares to that in other vertebrate
classes, we studied the appearance and morphological
differentiation of cerebral cortical neurons in embryonic
turtles. 3H-thymidine birthdate labeling and focal injections of
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in in vitro cortical slices revealed
that replicating cells occupy the outer ventricular zone, and
subsequently migrate to the ventricular surface where they
divide. Postmitotic neurons begin differentiating and elaborating
neurites while migrating back through the ventricular zone. On
their arrival at the top of the ventricular zone, pyramidal and
nonpyramidal neurons can be distinguished morphologically. Cells
with multipolar apical dendritic tufts ascending in the marginal
zone resemble immature pyramidal neurons. Neurons morphologically
similar to these early pyramidal cells were retrogradely labeled
by injections of the lipophilic tracer
1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine
perchlorate (diI) in a known pyramidal cell target, the thalamus.
Nonpyramidal neurons, resembling Cajal-Retzius cells, had
horizontally oriented long axons and dendrites coursing in the
plexiform primordium, the future marginal zone. With further
development morphological differences between cell types became
accentuated, and pyramidal cell somata were segregated into a
single cellular layer flanked by zones containing predominantly
nonpyramidal cells. Axon elaboration occurred early in embryonic
development, as pyramidal cells sent axonal branches to the
septum, thalamus, and cortical targets soon after their
generation, and the intracortical axonal plexus became
increasingly dense during embryonic life. Over a similar time
course the distribution of projecting neurons labeled by thalamic
diI injections changed from an initial homogeneous distribution
to a preferential location in the superficial half of the
cellular layer. Results from this study demonstrate several
features of cortical differentiation that are conserved in
reptiles and mammals, including similar early morphological
differentiation events, the early distinction of principal cell
types, and the parallel development of pyramidal and nonpyramidal
neurons. The context in which these similar developmental events
occur, however, differs profoundly in reptiles and mammals, with
differences in the timing and location of neurite elaboration and
differences in the appearance and architectonic organization of
the cortex. Comparison of cortical developmental patterns between
reptiles and mammals shows that similar functional cortical
circuits with balanced excitation and inhibition can emerge in
diverse cortical structures.},
