 abstract = {Proper lamination of the cerebral cortex is precisely
orchestrated, especially when neurons migrate from their place of
birth to their final destination. The consequences of failure or
delay in neuronal migration cause a wide range of disorders, such
as lissencephaly, schizophrenia, autism and mental retardation.
Neuronal migration is a dynamic process, which requires dynamic
remodeling of the cytoskeleton. In this context microtubules and
microtubule-related proteins have been suggested to play
important roles in the regulation of neuronal migration. Here, we
will review the dynamic aspects of neuronal migration and brain
development, describe the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
neuronal migration and elaborate on neuronal migration diseases.},
