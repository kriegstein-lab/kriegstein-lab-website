 abstract = {Ring chromosomes are structural aberrations commonly associated
with birth defects, mental disabilities and growth retardation.
Rings form after fusion of the long and short arms of a
chromosome, and are sometimes associated with large terminal
deletions. Owing to the severity of these large aberrations that
can affect multiple contiguous genes, no possible therapeutic
strategies for ring chromosome disorders have been proposed.
During cell division, ring chromosomes can exhibit unstable
behaviour leading to continuous production of aneuploid progeny
with low viability and high cellular death rate. The overall
consequences of this chromosomal instability have been largely
unexplored in experimental model systems. Here we generated human
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patient fibroblasts
containing ring chromosomes with large deletions and found that
reprogrammed cells lost the abnormal chromosome and duplicated
the wild-type homologue through the compensatory uniparental
disomy (UPD) mechanism. The karyotypically normal iPSCs with
isodisomy for the corrected chromosome outgrew co-existing
aneuploid populations, enabling rapid and efficient isolation of
patient-derived iPSCs devoid of the original chromosomal
aberration. Our results suggest a fundamentally different
function for cellular reprogramming as a means of 'chromosome
therapy' to reverse combined loss-of-function across many genes
in cells with large-scale aberrations involving ring structures.
In addition, our work provides an experimentally tractable human
cellular system for studying mechanisms of chromosomal number
control, which is of critical relevance to human development and
disease.},
