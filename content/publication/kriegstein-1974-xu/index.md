abstract: "To utilize the advantages offered by the large identified nerve cells of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica for cellular biological studies of development, we have devised simple techniques for growing this species in the laboratory in large number with a generation time as short as nineteen weeks. We have used the cultured animals to study the life cycle from fertilized egg to reproductive adult. The major developmental and behavioral changes occur at metamorphosis, when the larvae settle on the seaweed Laurencia pacifica and the locomotor and feeding behaviors are transformed into their adult forms. We have examined the timetable for the abandonment of larval behaviors and the emergence of adult ones and found that the transition from swimming to crawling occurs first and marks the onset of metamorphosis. The change from ciliary feeding to radular feeding occurs later and signals the end of metamorphosis. Other adult behaviors, such as the reflex responses and fixed-action patterns of the mantle organs, appear after metamorphosis."
