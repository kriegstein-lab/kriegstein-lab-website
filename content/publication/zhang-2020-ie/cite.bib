 abstract = {Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the prenatal neocortex progressively
generate different subtypes of glutamatergic projection neurons.
Following that, NSCs have a major switch in their progenitor
properties and produce $Î³$-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic)
interneurons for the olfactory bulb (OB), cortical
oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Herein, we provide evidence for
the molecular mechanism that underlies this switch in the state
of neocortical NSCs. We show that, at around E16.5, mouse
neocortical NSCs start to generate GSX2-expressing (GSX2(+))
intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). In vivo lineage-tracing
study revealed that GSX2(+) IPC population gives rise not only to
OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and
astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population.
We demonstrated that Sonic hedgehog signaling is both necessary
and sufficient for the generation of GSX2(+) IPCs by reducing
GLI3R protein levels. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we
identify the transcriptional profile of GSX2(+) IPCs and the
process of the lineage switch of cortical NSCs.},
