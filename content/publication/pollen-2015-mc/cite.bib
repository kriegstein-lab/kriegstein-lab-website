 abstract = {Radial glia, the neural stem cells of the neocortex, are located
in two niches: the ventricular zone and outer subventricular
zone. Although outer subventricular zone radial glia may generate
the majority of human cortical neurons, their molecular features
remain elusive. By analyzing gene expression across single cells,
we find that outer radial glia preferentially express genes
related to extracellular matrix formation, migration, and
stemness, including TNC, PTPRZ1, FAM107A, HOPX, and LIFR. Using
dynamic imaging, immunostaining, and clonal analysis, we relate
these molecular features to distinctive behaviors of outer radial
glia, demonstrate the necessity of STAT3 signaling for their cell
cycle progression, and establish their extensive proliferative
potential. These results suggest that outer radial glia directly
support the subventricular niche through local production of
growth factors, potentiation of growth factor signals by
extracellular matrix proteins, and activation of self-renewal
pathways, thereby enabling the developmental and evolutionary
expansion of the human neocortex.},
