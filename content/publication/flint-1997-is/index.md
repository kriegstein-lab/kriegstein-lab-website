abstract: "Neuronal migration disorders are often associated with intractable epilepsy. These cortical malformations are quite heterogeneous, suggesting that they may result from interference with a diverse set of processes during corticogenesis. Progress toward understanding the pathophysiologic basis of these disorders is coming from research into the basic mechanisms of corticogenesis, animal models of cortical malformations, and molecular genetic approaches to migration disorders."
