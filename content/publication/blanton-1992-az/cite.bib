 abstract = {1. The properties of receptors for amino acid neurotransmitters
expressed by developing cortical neurons were studied with the
use of whole-cell recording in the intact cerebral cortex of
embryonic turtles in vitro. The inhibitory agonist
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the excitatory agonist
glutamate were focally applied to single cells under voltage
clamp, and the ionic dependence, voltage dependence, and
pharmacological sensitivity of the responses were characterized.
The responses mediated by a glutamate receptor subtype, the
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, produced by glutamate and
by evoked release of an endogenous excitatory agonist, were
compared further. Fluctuation analysis was used to characterize
the properties of the NMDA channels and the mechanism of action
of receptor antagonists. 2. When postmitotic neurons first
appeared at stage 15, all neurons tested responded to GABA with a
current that reversed at the equilibrium potential for chloride
ions and that was sensitive to the GABAA receptor antagonist
bicuculline methiodide (BMI). As development proceeded, an
increasing proportion of neurons also responded with a
BMI-insensitive current that reversed near the equilibrium
potential for potassium ions. This current was blocked by the
GABAB receptor antagonist 3-amino-2-propyl phosponic acid
(phaclofen). The GABAB agonist baclofen, however, failed to
produce a detectable postsynaptic current. 3. Neurons at stage 15
showed a biphasic response to glutamate that reversed at the
equilibrium potential for cations. All neurons tested showed a
slow, sustained response associated with an increase in current
variance compared with background, and, as development proceeded,
an increasing proportion also exhibited a fast, transient
response. Both fast and slow responses varied linearly with
voltage in the absence of Mg2+ ions, but the addition of Mg2+
ions to the bathing medium attenuated the slow response at
hyperpolarized potentials. As a result, the current-voltage
relation of the slow response in the presence of Mg2+ ions
exhibited a region of negative slope conductance, like that of
currents mediated by NMDA receptors. 4. The fast and slow
responses to glutamate differed in their pharmacological
sensitivity. The fast responses were sensitive to the non-NMDA
receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX),
whereas the slow responses were sensitive to the NMDA receptor
antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV). 5. When
cells were held at -70 mV, glutamate evoked a fluctuating current
consisting of channel currents with a mean open time, tau, of
4.42 +/- 0.47 (SE) ms in early postmitotic neurons at stage 15
and 4.99 +/- 0.38 ms at stages 17-20.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400
