 abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted via mosquitoes and
sex to cause congenital neurodevelopmental defects, including
microcephaly. Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are
associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we
found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV
infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins
including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV
nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was
sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63
localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome
disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt
centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or CEP63 loss decreased
the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase
1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV
infection also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the
CEP63 interactor DTX4, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades TBK1.
Therefore, we propose that ZIKV disrupts CEP63 function to
increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of
TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response.},
