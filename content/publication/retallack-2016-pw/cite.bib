 abstract = {The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with
abnormal brain development constitute a global health emergency.
Congenital ZIKV infection produces a range of mild to severe
pathologies, including microcephaly. To understand the
pathophysiology of ZIKV infection, we used models of the
developing brain that faithfully recapitulate the tissue
architecture in early to midgestation. We identify the brain cell
populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV infection in
primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism of viral
entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects cultured
brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV
preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes,
oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons
were less susceptible to infection. These findings suggest
mechanisms for microcephaly and other pathologic features of
infants with congenital ZIKV infection that are not explained by
neural stem cell infection alone, such as calcifications in the
cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking the
glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV
infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in
a glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we
evaluate 2,177 compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy. We
show that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced viral
proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects in glial cell
lines and human astrocytes. Our characterization of infection in
the developing human brain clarifies the pathogenesis of
congenital ZIKV infection and provides the basis for
investigating possible therapeutic strategies to safely alleviate
or prevent the most severe consequences of the epidemic.},
