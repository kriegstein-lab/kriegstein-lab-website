 abstract = {Oscillations in intracellular free calcium concentration
([Ca(2+)](i)) occur spontaneously in immature neurons of the
developing cerebral cortex. Here, we show that developing murine
cortical neurons exhibit calcium oscillations in response to
direct activation of the mGluR5 subtype of the group I
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). In contrast, other
manipulations that elicit [Ca(2+)](i) increases produce simple,
nonoscillatory changes. Furthermore, we find that spontaneous
oscillatory [Ca(2+)](i) activity is blocked by antagonists of
group I mGluRs, suggesting a specific role for mGluR activation
in the promotion of oscillatory [Ca(2+)](i) dynamics in immature
cortical neurons. The oscillatory pattern of [Ca(2+)](i)
increases produced by mGluR activation might play a role in the
regulation of gene expression and the control of developmental
events.},
