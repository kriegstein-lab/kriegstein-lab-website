 abstract = {Cortical organoids are self-organizing three-dimensional cultures
that model features of the developing human cerebral cortex(1,2).
However, the fidelity of organoid models remains unclear(3-5).
Here we analyse the transcriptomes of individual primary human
cortical cells from different developmental periods and cortical
areas. We find that cortical development is characterized by
progenitor maturation trajectories, the emergence of diverse cell
subtypes and areal specification of newborn neurons. By contrast,
organoids contain broad cell classes, but do not recapitulate
distinct cellular subtype identities and appropriate progenitor
maturation. Although the molecular signatures of cortical areas
emerge in organoid neurons, they are not spatially segregated.
Organoids also ectopically activate cellular stress pathways,
which impairs cell-type specification. However, organoid stress
and subtype defects are alleviated by transplantation into the
mouse cortex. Together, these datasets and analytical tools
provide a framework for evaluating and improving the accuracy of
cortical organoids as models of human brain development.},
