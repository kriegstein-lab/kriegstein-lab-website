I received my doctorate degree in developmental neuroscience from the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Supervisor: Zhen-Ge Luo). During my PhD training, I became fascinated by the kaleidoscopic behaviors of neural stem cells (NSCs), which could either proliferate or differentiate to precisely develop into the delicate neural system. Now, I am curious about the coordination of the neural system with other systems during embryonic development. Also, I am interested in modeling human developmental disorders using cultured brain organoids.
