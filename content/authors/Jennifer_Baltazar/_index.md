I am a visiting grad student in the Kriegstein lab as part of my master’s program in Heidelberg, Germany. Starting my master’s I focused mainly on neuroscience, especially neurodevelopmental disorders. Part of my last project was to investigate the effect of specific mutations appearing in Autism Spectrum Disorder on synaptic mechanisms. Therefore, I worked with stem cells, induced neurons and got routine in electrophysiological methods, calcium imaging, and confocal microscopy. Now here at UCSF, I am using organoids as main model to investigate brain development as well as neurodevelopmental disorders.
