Dr. Zhou is interested in dissecting human brain circuit development. During his Ph.D., he found a new "push-pull" circuit mechanism to control the E-I balance of rodent serotonin neurons: individual cells could receive excitation and inhibition inputs from the same brain area. As a postdoc, he studies how early cortical circuits form in the human brain and their interaction with the brain microenvironments.
