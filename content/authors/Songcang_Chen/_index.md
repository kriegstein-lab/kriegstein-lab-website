Dr. Chenâ€™s research mainly focuses on vitamin D receptor (VDR) biology and the role of vitamin D in hypertension and cardiometabolic disease. He successfully generated floxed VDR mice and developed several types of tissue/cell-specific VDR knockout mice including CD4+ T lymphocytes. Recently, his is interested in stem cell research and neuroscience.
